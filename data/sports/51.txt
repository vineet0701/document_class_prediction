But the primary culprit, according to Michael White, author of \u201cShipwrecks of the California Coast,\u201d has been fog.\u201cThe fog on the California coast \u2014 at times, you can\u2019t see your hand in front of your face,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take the right precautionary measures, you\u2019re going to have problems.\u201dIn 1923, lack of visibility amid fog was blamed in the largest ever peacetime loss of naval ships.
