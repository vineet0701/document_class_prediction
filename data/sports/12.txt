Despite being cleared, the backup lineman was still suspended for the season-opener against USC.Meanwhile, Hand, a senior,\u00a0was not driving but was sleeping at the wheel of the car with the keys in the ignition in a parking lot when he was arrested Saturday.As\u00a0college football fans and media opine on how Alabama\u00a0coach Nick Saban should discipline Hand, Taylor joined me on \"The Opening Kickoff\" on WNSP-FM 105.5 on Wednesday to\u00a0compare and contrast the two arrests.He was quick to point out he was surprised the narrative of Hand's story changed in 24 hours, but said \"If he was drinking, why would you put yourself in that situation.\"Taylor\u00a0is quick to point out there is discipline.\"A lot of people seem to think since he doesn't punish us in the public eye that he doesn't punish us,\" Taylor said. \"We have our punishment. It's in-house. What happens at Bama stays at Bama, and we like to keep it that. It's not for everybody to know. It if it were for everybody to know, everybody would be playing ball for us.\"RELATED: Taylor on the hardest hit he ever tookHe points out Saban disciplines in a number of ways. There are suspensions from games, practices and team meetings. There are also early-morning workouts.With that said, Saban, according to Taylor, is most interested is making sure his players are OK, rather that satisfying public perception.\"Everyone thinks I met with Nick\u00a0Saban and got a butt-chewing,\" he said. \"That wasn't the case at all. It was more worries-about-me situation. He wanted to do anything he could to help me get\u00a0past it.\"That's what a lot of people don't see in Nick Saban. They only see the great ball coach. At the end of the day, he's willing to do whatever he has to do to help take care of his players and sure we're OK.\"However, Taylor - who never returned to football due to a series of migraines\u00a0- is quick to point out that a suspension of any kind is extreme in the eyes of the player.\"Taking away any opportunity for a player to get better hurts, regardless of whether it is a game or practice,\" he said. \"Playing alongside those boys for so long, they become your family. The smallest suspension from anything hurts.\"Taylor said there is a sense of letting your team down when you get suspended, but other players continue to support their teammates.\"Teammates always have your back, but they'll also tell you you're wrong,\" said Taylor, who cited Brandon Greene as an example in his case.\u00a0 Yes, because he and Hand are high-profile\u00a0athletes, he believes arrests are blown up by the media more than it should be.\"I think the media is doing their job,\" he said. \"They're trying to get a story and blow something up as big as they can. At the end of the day, the media has no say.\"Yet, Taylor was asked: Why were you suspended even though you were exonerated from the DUI?\"Basically, the cards were\u00a0stacked against me,\" he explained. The way it blew up he had to do something. I understood I wasn't mad a bit. It was something I had to go through.\"View CommentsAbout UsAbout Alabama Media GroupJobs at Alabama Media GroupAdvertise with usNews In EducationFrequently Asked QuestionsAbout AL.comContact UsOnline StoreAlready a Subscriber?Manage your subscriptionDelivery feedbackPlace a vacation holdMake a paymentCustomer ServicePlace an adGet home deliveryPromote your event in our calendarSend us an emailSubmit a news tipBuy newspaper front pages, poster and moreAL.com SectionsNewsBusinessSportsHigh School SportsEntertainmentLivingTravelOpinionObituariesJobsAutosReal EstateApartment RentalsClassifiedsLocal BusinessesYour Regional News PagesAnniston/GadsdenBirminghamHuntsvilleMobileMontgomeryTuscaloosaGulf Coast BeachesOn the GoMobile Apps | Tablet AppsMore on AL.comVideosPhotosInteract with usWeatherPost a jobPost a free classified adSell your carSell/rent your homeSite Map & searchSponsor ContentBecome a MemberThe Birmingham NewsThe Huntsville TimesPress-RegisterFree newslettersFollow UsTwitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy \u00a9 2017 Alabama Media Group.
