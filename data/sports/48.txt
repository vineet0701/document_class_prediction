Forty-five LED displays covering more than 13,500 square feet and 16.5 million-plus LEDs will be installed in and around the arena.5,100 square feet of pure beauty. #LittleCaesarsArena pic.twitter.com/nzFEUuVWwr\u2014 Detroit Red Wings (@DetroitRedWings) July 17, 2017Daktronics is designing, manufacturing and installing the state-of-the-art video displays at Little Caesars Arena, which will be home to the Detroit Red Wings and Pistons, as well as other entertainment and community events.The Little Caesars Arena scoreboard will be the largest system in the NHL by viewable area.\"Today fans have very high expectations for the size and quality of displays and the information they provide,\" Olympic Entertainment president and CEO Tom Wilson said in a release. \"This system will exceed fan expectations in the seats, in the concourse and in new spaces like the expansive Chevrolet Plaza. Fans seated in the ends of the arena will experience the same size display as those seated on Little Caesars Arena sidelines, an amenity that few other arenas offer today.\"[enhanced link]The centerhung system will deliver a continue, seamless display connecting all four sides, with each side measuring about 28 feet high by 43 1/2 feet wide and will feature 6-millimeter line spacing. The high-resolution system features variable content zoning, which allows each side to show one large image or for it to be divided into multiple sections. Those sections have the ability to show any variety of live video, instant replay, game statistics and information, animations and graphics, and sponsorship messages.The scoreboard will have four under-mount displays, targeted to fans who are sitting closer to the action. Those displays will be more than 7 feet high by 9 1/2 feet wide, they'll feature 6-millimeter line spacing, and they're geared to show complementary content to the main displays.In all, the scoreboard will boast about 11 million LEDs.A pair of ribbon displays will circle the seating areas at the arena, each measuring 2 1/2 feet high with 15-millimeter spacing. The upper ribbon will be 1,066 feet long, while the lower ribbon will be 915 feet. Additionally, 15 ribbon displays will be installed throughout the seating bowl.Seven exterior displays will greet fans and event-goers as they enter Little Caesars Arena. Scorer's tables and basket stanchion displays for basketball games, as well as dasher displays for hockey games, are included in the installation.In the installation, Daktronics will include its Show Control System, which provides a combination of display control software, video processing, data integration and playback hardware.View CommentsAbout UsMLive Media GroupOur TeamAdvertiseFrequently Asked QuestionsContact UsJobs at MLiveSubscriptionsNewspaper | Digital Editions | eNewslettersThe Ann Arbor NewsThe Bay City TimesThe Flint JournalThe Grand Rapids PressJackson Citizen PatriotKalamazoo GazetteMuskegon ChronicleThe Saginaw NewsMLive SectionsNewsBusinessSportsHigh School SportsEntertainmentLivingOpinionObituariesJobsAutosReal EstateApartment RentalsClassifiedsLocal DealsLocal BusinessesBusiness Resource CenterYour Regional News PagesAnn ArborBay CityDetroitFlintGrand RapidsJacksonKalamazooLansingMuskegonSaginawMobileMobile apps | Tablet appsMore on MLivePhotosVideoWeatherPost a jobPost a free classified adSell your carSell/Rent your homeApartments and RentalsSponsor ContentFollow UsTwitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy \u00a9 2017 MLive Media Group.
