Can't jump the fence and establish ground out of playView conversation\u00b7Andrew Dominijanni@ADominijanni Aug 1 Replying to @MikeLaPenta@sporer Ha yeah, given Jeter into the stands precedent, I was mostly joking, but jeez...View conversation\u00b7Christopher Crawford@Crawford_MILB Aug 1 Replying to @sporer I was kinda hoping he caught an actual banana, but this is pretty good.View conversation\u00b7hunt for Rocktober\u26be\ufe0f@ashbash_3 Aug 1 Replying to @sporer@AudieRoss @AudieRoss here's the run tooView conversation\u00b7Seth Rothman@SethDRothman Aug 1 Replying to @ADominijanni@sporer No. As long as he's not touching an out of play area when he makes the catch, he's allowed to fall out of play after catching it.View conversation\u00b7Nicholas Fox@CT_FOX Aug 1 Replying to @sporer pic.twitter.com/SVIYkPrns4View conversation\u00b7Wizzy W@DavidWalker991 Aug 1 Replying to @acmalin927@sporer@LanzOfHonor No, sir. If his momentum brings him over the wall, he is out.View conversation\u00b7Jeff Belben@MrBelben Aug 1 Replying to @SethDRothman@sporer@ADominijanni Believe it would have been only one base with a \"catch and carry\" ruleView conversation\u00b7TodaysTrades.org@Hey_Tom_Henley Aug 1 Replying to @sporer that man is a baseball player!View conversation\u00b7Seth Rothman@SethDRothman Aug 1 Replying to @MrBelben@sporer@ADominijanni Correct. It's rule 5.06(b). Runners get one base each if a fielder falls out of play after making a catch.View conversation\u00b7JKrellDavis@jkrelldavis Aug 1 Replying to @sporer@davis850 Hey @davis850View conversation\u00b7Enter a topic, @name, or fullnameSettings Help Back to top \u00b7 Turn images off"}
