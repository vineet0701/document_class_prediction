They have added more than 10 promising players, and will definitely be challenging Juventus for Serie A.permalinkembedsavereportgive goldreply[\u2013]the_gregor_samsa[S] -2 points-1 points0 points 4 days ago\u00a0(2 children)Look at Chelsea though - they look like they've almost completely restructured their squad.permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[\u2013]BenedictoCharleston 5 points6 points7 points 4 days ago\u00a0(0 children)Most of those are just coming back from loan, Chelsea already owned them.

At this rate they will be back in the top of europe in no time. With other great teams like Juve, Roma and Napoli and decent sub-top teams like Lazio, Fiorentina and Inter (also spending a lot money) the Serie A seems to become stronger and stronger and may compete with la liga/bundesliga/the prem in the future. And the single biggest transfer is Neymar obviouslypermalinkembedsavereportgive goldreplyaboutblogaboutsource codeadvertisecareershelpsite rulesFAQwikireddiquettemod guidelinescontact usapps & toolsReddit for iPhoneReddit for Androidmobile websitebuttons<3reddit goldredditgiftsUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy. \u00a9 2017 reddit inc.
