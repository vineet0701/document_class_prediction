With Tatum and Gordon-Levitt providing the English language voices, Detectives Gregor Anghel and Iosef Baciu are played on screen by Romanian actors, Florin Piersic Jr. (Killing Time) and Corneliu Ulici (The Devil Inside).As a Ronald Reagan-masked gunman, clich\u00e9 rich trailer set-up, car chases in Bucharest and old school boomboxes make clear, the six-episode Comrade Detective is no Gorky Park and certainly no The Americans. Then again, it\u00a0doesn\u2019t need to be because as the scene at the American Embassy in the trailer reveals, this one is playing for laughs at everyone\u2019s expense.Jenny Slate and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny will also be providing their vocal talents to the show as will Jake Johnson, Jason Mantzoukas, Nick Offerman and Fred Armisen. Oscar winners Kim Basinger, and Mahershala Ali, along with Tracey Letts, Bobby Cannavale, Richard Jenkins, Debra Winger, Mark Duplass, Katie Aselton Duplass, Jerrod Carmichael, Bo Burnham and John Early are on-board voiceoverwise too.Gatewood and Tanaka EP with director Rhys Thomas, Tatum and his Free Association Reid Carolin (Logan Lucky), Peter Kiernan (Mad Love) and Andrew Schneider are EPs too with A24\u2019s Ravi Nandan (The Carmichael Show) and John Hodges\u00a0(Safety Not Guaranteed).Filed Under: TVBreaking NewsTrailersA24AmazonChanning TatumComrade Detective Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy33 Comments Cancel reply Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Catchem \u2022 on Jul 27, 2017 7:56 amLooks like one of those Adult Swim shows and can\u2019t see myself binge watching this. Seems tough to sustain. They should just bring back Sledge Hammer.Reply RSG \u2022 on Jul 27, 2017 8:34 pmOof.
