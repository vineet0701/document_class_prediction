Lightstorm Entertainment is the production company behind \u201cAvatar\u201d and other Cameron-directed features, including \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day\u201d and \u201cTitanic.\u201dLandau hinted at breakthroughs to come. \u201cWe also know that these next films promise to be even more ambitious than the first film,\u201d he noted.\u201cAvatar is the ideal type of film for us,\u201d said Letteri. \u201cJim\u2019s vision for the world of Pandora was always so much bigger than what we created for the first film. Helping him expand the language of cinema through new narratives set in such an expansive universe is the type of opportunity that rarely comes along twice. Projects like this allow everyone involved to push themselves to do their best work.\u201d\u201cThe excitement at Weta around \u2018Avatar\u2019 is obvious and the fact is that we have already been working on it for a number of years,\u201d said Weta Digital executive producer David Conley. \u201cDuring that period we have grown the company to a size and model that allows us to expand beyond any one project. This enables us to find a mix of other films that can help us grow along with \u2018Avatar,\u2019 as is the case with \u2018Alita: Battle Angel,\u2019 \u2018Avengers: Infinity War\u2019 and \u2018Mortal Engines,\u2019 to name a few of the other films we are currently working on.\u201dFiled Under:AvatarJames CameronJoe LetteriJon LandauWeta Digital Want to read more articles like this one?SUBSCRIBE TO VARIETY TODAY.Post A Comment1 TV\u2018Mad Men\u2019 Stars Join Matthew Weiner Amazon SeriesTV\u2018Thrones\u2019 New Episode Leaks, Not Connected to HBO HackTV\u2018Karate Kid\u2019 Sequel Series Heads to YouTube RedTV\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Recasts Owen\u2019s Sister for Season 14Oscars: Venice, Telluride, Toronto Lineups Provide Awards Season Snapshot\u2018Detroit\u2019: Annapurna\u2019s Pulse-Pounding Debut Release Aims for Oscar GoldChristopher Nolan\u2019s \u2018Dunkirk\u2019 Is the First Slam-Dunk Oscar Contender of 2017\u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 Scores Hulu Its First Big Emmy NominationsVariety JobsCreative Development CoordinatorTriptyk Studios, New York, New YorkAccount/Project Coordinator (Ad Agency)Petrol Advertising, Burbank, CaliforniaMedia SpecialistBridgewater Associates, Westport, ConnecticutExecutive Director, Aspen FilmCompany Confidential, Aspen, ColoradoAssociate Director, YouTuber & Gamer PartnershipsSave the Children, Fairfield, ConnecticutSee More Jobs MarketplaceLeave a Reply 1 Comment Cancel reply Comments are moderated.
