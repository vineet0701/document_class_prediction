It didn\u2019t need that kind of qualification: these are high times for UK rap in its various forms, something this year\u2019s Mercury shortlist reflects. Stormzy\u2019s deservedly chart-topping Gang Signs & Prayer sits alongside J Hus\u2019s gritty fusion of road rap, bashment and afrobeat, and Loyle Carner\u2019s idiosyncratic, melancholy and very British take on hip-hop.Mercury prize 2017: Ed Sheeran, Stormzy and the xx feature on shortlist Read morePerhaps striving for balance, the shortlist seems keen to suggest that the kind of alt-rock that once made up the NME\u2019s primary diet is in equally rude health. You might have expected to see the xx\u2019s I See You and Alt-J\u2019s Relaxer among the nominees, while Blossoms are successful enough that the road sign informing drivers they\u2019ve arrived in Stockport now notes the town is the \u201cHOME OF BLOSSOMS\u201d: more surprising is the appearance of Glass Animals and amiable guitar group the Big Moon. Elsewhere, the Mercury panel would doubtless argue that there\u2019s no such thing as a typical Mercury winner, but anyone with any longstanding interest in the award knows that there patently is. It\u2019s not meant as any reflection on the undoubted quality of Kate Tempest\u2019s Let Them Eat Chaos \u2013 there\u2019s something extremely potent about its melding of performance poetry, righteous political anger and post-dubstep soundscapes \u2013 to suggest that it seems to tick all the Mercury boxes: it presents urban music in such a way that BBC2 could broadcast it being performed in its entirety on a Saturday evening in between programmes about John Betjeman and the train journey between Euston and Glasgow; it\u2019s the kind of thing that broadsheet Sunday supplement features are made of. If Tempest seems too obvious a winner, then Sampha\u2019s unorthodox fusion of soul-bearing piano balladry and R&B might be worth a flutter. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stockport\u2019s finest... Blossoms.

Whether the judging panel feel Sheeran\u2019s success is so immense and so era-defining that it can\u2019t be ignored \u2013 even his loudest detractors would have their work cut out arguing that he hasn\u2019t proved hugely influential, judging by the charts \u2013 or they genuinely feel his skill as an unashamedly populist songwriter deserves recognition, or there\u2019s a degree of mischievous, knowingly controversial intent involved, is an intriguing question. More intriguing still is what isn\u2019t on the Mercury shortlist. A succession of big names that might reasonably have expected to be there aren\u2019t: Laura Marling\u2019s Semper Femina; Sleaford Mods\u2019 English Tapas; Gorillaz\u2019 Humans (although the latter probably queered their pitch by demanding to be removed from the shortlist in 2001). Even the Rolling Stones\u2019 triumphant return to basics, Blue and Lonesome, could have been in with a shout. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Missing in action... Jane Weaver. Photograph: PR Company HandoutIt\u2019s hard to escape the feeling that if you wanted to have guitar based alt-rock, the last 12 months has seen albums noticeably more exciting than some of the nominees in that field, not least Jane Weaver\u2019s fantastic psychedelic exploration Modern Kosmology or the unconventional art-punk of Sacred Paws, while in the field of dance music, Actress\u2019s AZD is arguably more adventurous and out-there than anything on the list. As usual, there\u2019s nothing from any part of the spectrum of hard rock (\u201c[metal] is a niche genre that many people don\u2019t listen to,\u201d as Mercury prize chair Simon Frith explained some years ago, helpfully explaining why even its biggest names, from Iron Maiden to Black Sabbath to Bring Me the Horizon remain little-known cult figures, sadly unable to attract the kind of vast audience that performance poetry set to post-dubstep soundscapes invariably garners). More unexpectedly, while the annual solitary jazz nomination is present and correct \u2013 trumpeter Laura Jurd\u2019s electric-era Miles Davis-inspired quartet Dinosaur are doubtless grateful for the sudden burst of publicity outside of the jazz world, said burst of publicity being one of the few unequivocally positive things the Mercury Prize does \u2013 but there\u2019s no music on the shortlist you could even broadly describe as folk, a curious state of affairs in a year that\u2019s seen both Richard Dawson\u2019s hugely ambitious and idiosyncratic song-cycle Peasant and the thrillingly uncompromising return of British folk\u2019s grande dame Shirley Collins after a 38 year absence from recording. There are some great albums present and correct, but at the very least, it\u2019s hard not to feel that British music over the last 12 months has been noticeably more diverse than the Mercury shortlist suggests.The full Mercury prize 2017 shortlistAlt-J: RelaxerThe Big Moon: Love in the 4th DimensionBlossoms: BlossomsLoyle Carner: Yesterday\u2019s GoneDinosaur: Together, As OneGlass Animals: How to Be a Human BeingJ Hus: Common SenseSampha: ProcessEd Sheeran: \u00f7Stormzy: Gang Signs & PrayerKate Tempest: Let Them Eat ChaosThe xx: I See YouTopicsMercury prize 2017Pop and rockAwards and prizesEd SheeranStormzyKate TempestcommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content View all comments >Order by newestoldestrecommendationsShow 252550100AllThreads collapsedexpandedunthreadedLoading comments\u2026 Trouble loading?View more commentsmost viewed The Guardianback to tophomeUKworldsportfootballopinioncultureselectedbusinesslifestylefashionenvironmenttechtravelall sectionsclosehomeUKeducationmediasocietylawscotlandwalesnorthern irelandworldeuropeUSamericasasiaaustraliaafricamiddle eastcitiesdevelopmentsportfootballcricketrugby unionF1tennisgolfcyclingboxingracingrugby leaguefootballlive scorestablescompetitionsresultsfixturesclubsopinioncolumnistsletterseditorialscultureselectedfilmtv & radiomusicselectedgamesbooksart & designstageclassicalbusinesseconomicsbankingretailmarketseurozonelifestylefoodrecipeshealth & fitnesslove & sexfamilywomenhome & gardenfashionenvironmentclimate changewildlifeenergypollutiontechtravelUKeuropeUSmoneypropertysavingspensionsborrowingcareersscienceprofessional networksthe observertoday's paperobituariesg2weekendthe guidesaturday reviewsunday's papercommentthe new reviewobserver magazinemembershipcrosswordsblogeditorquickcrypticprizequipticgeniusspeedyeverymanazedweekendvideopodcastsdigital archiveCulture\u203aMusic\u203aMercury prize 2017booksmusictv & radioart & designfilmgamesclassicalstageback to topbecome a supportermake a contributionsecuredropsolve technical issueadvertise with uswork for uscontact uscomplaints & correctionsterms & conditionsprivacy policycookie policydigital newspaper archiveall topicsall contributorsFacebookTwitter\u00a9 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
