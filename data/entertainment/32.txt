The technology was new, James Cameron had shown that it could be used effectively, and, more importantly, theaters could charge more for it. Unfortunately, the product rarely lived up to the tech. Even when studios finally figured out how to do solid 3D post-conversions, the appeal was wearing off. Every tentpole was in 3D, but audiences were losing interest because for every Gravity or Hugo, there were 20 other movies where the 3D didn\u2019t improve the experience. While tentpole movies are still getting 3D post-conversions, it\u2019s clear that at least American audiences think that 2D is just fine.And IMAX is listening. According to THR, IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond says they \u201cwill play more digital 2D versions of Hollywood movies domestically, given a \u2018clear preference\u2019 from consumers for 2D in North America.\u201d Currently, Dunkirk is only playing in IMAX 2D, and it did quite well this weekend. While you could argue that\u2019s Christopher Nolan using his power to make sure his movie isn\u2019t forced into 3D, IMAX also revealed that when it shows Blade Runner 2049 this October, those screenings will be in 2D only.IMAX will also be showing preference to movies that use their cameras. Movies that have been converted into IMAX will be getting one-week only showings in order for IMAX to show more movies, but films that were shot in IMAX like Dunkirk and the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War will receive longer runs.Personally, I think this is the smart way to go. Speaking from experience, when I go to press screenings now, fewer and fewer are shown in 3D, and it\u2019s clear across the board that 3D hasn\u2019t really taken off. When you go to buy a new TV, the selling point isn\u2019t that they\u2019re in 3D (most new models aren\u2019t), but rather that they\u2019re 4K. People would rather have a better-quality image than stuff coming out the screen. While I don\u2019t think 3D is totally dead, especially since it continues to do well overseas, I\u2019m glad that we\u2019re returning more to 2D. If there are filmmakers who want to actually use 3D rather that studios looking to make a quick buck, the technology will still be there.Related ContentThis Week in Animation: 'In a Heartbeat' Steals All the Feels; New 'Voltron' Toys Debut Friday Box Office: 'The Dark Tower' Takes the Lead Over 'Dunkirk' 'The Dark Tower\u2019: How the Movie Mythology Differs from Stephen King's Books 'The Dark Tower' Fan Reviews: What Did You Think?
