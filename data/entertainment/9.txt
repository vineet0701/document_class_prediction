This summer proved no different. He doesn\u2019t have a brand new album to promote. No matter. He\u2019s touring the country all the same, delivering a precise, joyful set for fans new and old.So what do you get with a live Isaak show? The following tell-tale signs say it all.No FlinchingYou never have to worry about the lyrics or between song banter coming from the stage. Isaak and friends keep the proceedings family friendly. Some slight innuendo aimed at his band members\u2019 love lives is as \u201ctawdry\u201d as it gets.Thank You \u2026 Thank You Very MuchThe lead singer can\u2019t stop feting his fellow musicians. During the July 28 show at the Hudson Gardens in Littleton, Colo. Isaak gave a huge introduction to his fellow musicians \u2026 within the first two songs. They\u2019ve been together 32 years, and it shows in the best of ways. Those shout outs don\u2019t feel perfunctory. It\u2019s genuine.Funny, Funny BanterAre the jokes off the cuff or part of the rigorously rehearsed routine? Hard to say, but here\u2019s betting a good chunk of the humor is canned for our amusement. It hardly matters. Isaak brings his theatrical chops to the stage each performance. Remember his charming Showtime series \u201cThe Chris Isaak Show?\u201d Or his darker turn in \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs?\u201d He delivers his lines, staged or improv-generated, with aplomb.Nary a False FalsettoSingers\u2019 voices often show some wear and tear on tour. Their instrument, pushed every night, can only duplicate the hits so religiously. Isaak\u2019s voice seems as ageless as the singer himself. This critic has seen him live seven times and can\u2019t remember a single cracked note during that span. It may happen at other stops on the tour. Here\u2019s betting those false notes are the exception proving the rule.Senior CentersIsaak\u2019s fan base isn\u2019t as young as it once was. That\u2019s being delicate. The singer\u2019s biggest burst of fame came when \u201cWicked Game\u201d caught fire on both MTV and the music charts around 1991. So it\u2019s natural his concerts wouldn\u2019t have Millennials wrangling for space in the front row. His style also makes a difference. Isaak leans heavily on retro rock sensibilities, an aesthetic that confounds today\u2019s teens.No Clunkers HereNeed a bathroom break mid-concert? Good luck. Isaak\u2019s spit-shined delivery and impressive back catalog leave little room for live clunkers. Pick a less familiar slow song at your own acoustic peril.Self Deprecation on SteroidsWe\u2019d all like to look as good as Isaak does at 61. Or 51. Even his crooked nose, a victim of his early pugilistic days, works in his favor. He\u2019s still relentlessly, cheerfully self-deprecating in concert. And, while some stars attempt a similar tone with mixed results, the singer\u2019s self deprecation comes certified gold.No Politics, No ProblemWhat does the San Francisco native think about President Donald Trump? Health care reform? The wall? Darned if we know. Isaak leaves the political fights behind when he hits the stage. Need a break from our toxic political culture? Here\u2019s your answer. It\u2019s just the songs, ma\u2019am, and it\u2019s refreshing now \u2026 more \u2026 than \u2026 ever.The Ghosts of Rock Music PastIsaak owes plenty to the legends of rock and soul. Think Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash and Roy Orbison. Some stars wouldn\u2019t go near those singers\u2019 songbooks. Their shadows are too lengthy, too intimidating. Isaak can\u2019t help but pay tribute to them in concert. It\u2019s a display of raw affection, but it also yields some catchy covers. No one can out-Cash Cash\u2019s \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d for example. The song remains sturdy enough for any number of incarnations.
