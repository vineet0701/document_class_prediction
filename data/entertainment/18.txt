Their introduction proceeded along a suitably measured trajectory and avoided cheap tricks \u2014 Jon bonding with a dragon, say, or Dany muttering \u201cthere\u2019s something familiar about you \u2026\u201d \u2014 unless you count Jon pocketing his resurrection trump card. (Maybe he figured zombie army warnings were enough tales from the crypt for one meeting?)[Want exclusive \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d explainers as well as the internet\u2019s best articles on this week\u2019s episode? Sign up for our Season 7 newsletter here.]But the hub connecting the various spokes of Sunday\u2019s episode, \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Justice,\u201d was the queen herself, who, we were reminded by Mycroft the Iron Banker, was the spit and image of her father even as everyone else was trying to distance themselves from the sins of their ancestors.She was the monster in King\u2019s Landing that kept Dany from worrying about Jon\u2019s monsters beyond the wall. She was the subject of a \u201cWho Knows Her Better?\u201d spat between Sansa and Littlefinger. She was the orchestrator of a maliciously brilliant scheme to kill off an outstanding rival and pay off her family\u2019s debts in the process, with Jaime\u2019s assault on Highgarden, the Tyrell headquarters.PhotoFrom left: Rosabell Laurenti Sellers, Hafthor Julius Bjornsson, Lena Headey and Indira Varma in \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dCredit Helen Sloan/HBO And of course, she was the administerer of the cruel justice of the episode\u2019s title, as she had her revenge on Ellaria Sand. We figured nothing pleasant would come out of Euron Greyjoy\u2019s pledge, made in the season premiere, to bring Cersei a priceless gift. He is a savage marauder, after all, and she a ruthless striver \u2014 both claimed power through shocking acts of violence. What would be twisted and depraved enough to serve as a fitting engagement present for the story\u2019s most psychopathic pairing since Ramsay and Myranda hunted girls together? Continue reading the main storyAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyTurns out Euron\u2019s kidnapping last week of Ellaria and her daughter Tyene was the demented pirate equivalent of a trip to Tiffany\u2019s. He presented his prize at the Red Keep and then Cersei subjected Ellaria to the same horror that she herself had suffered with the loss of Myrcella, fatally poisoning Tyene with a kiss.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIt was an eye-for-an-eye with a twist: Ellaria will now be made to spend the rest of her days rotting in a cell, alongside her daughter, who presumably will do so in more literal fashion. The punishment called back to Cersei\u2019s own dark terror, expressed last season after Myrcella\u2019s murder, about imagining dead loved ones decomposing in the grave. You will \u201cwatch her beautiful face collapse to bone,\u201d Cersei told Ellaria.Which is to say that like many punishments, it said more about the inflicter than the victim. It was a sign that even though Cersei 1) achieved ultimate power in spite of her enemies and oppressors, and 2) effectively solidified it through some savvy moves, she is still haunted by loss and fear and focused on settling old scores. At the same time Jaime, her closest companion, seems ever more uncertain about the future, which could be a problem.It suggests that, as I\u2019ve said before, Cersei\u2019s venom probably won\u2019t succeed as a long-term strategy. \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d seems to be about the evolution from a bloody, top-down monarchy-by-force to a more democratic way forward as humanity bands together to confront the White Walker threat, standing in for catastrophic climate change or some other Global Crisis to Be Named Later. The classic race to rule the Seven Kingdoms will eventually amount to a contest, to paraphrase Davos, to be the skeleton that sits on the Iron Throne.PhotoSophie Turner and Aidan Gillen in \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dCredit Helen Sloan/HBO But for now, before this entrenched game of thrones gets flipped on its revenge-addled head? It\u2019s working out pretty well!Of course it helps that the other side is floundering. Team Targaryen finally made the triumphant crossing of the Narrow Sea last season, and the armada was something to behold. Hundreds of ships, manned by Unsullied and Dothraki warriors. The Greyjoys, the Dornish Sands and House Tyrell along for the ride, with air support from the first three dragons anyone has seen in centuries. It looked like an irresistible force, which is why the show has spent the time since putting its thumb on the narrative scale in the name of keeping things interesting.Now the Greyjoys are captive \u2014 or, in Theon\u2019s case, back in the pathetic zone \u2014 and their fleet is in tatters. The Dorne ladies have been decimated. House Tyrell has been conquered. The Unsullied are stuck a continent away from the action and the aquaphobic Dothraki are stranded at Dragonstone. The dragons are still around, but Dany\u2019s advisers are urging her not to take the totally sensible-seeming step of using them to torch Euron\u2019s ships, because it would be too risky for her. (When Tyrion explains it, it almost makes sense.)\u201cThis place has changed,\u201d Davos said upon his return to Dragonstone. But has it, really? During Davos\u2019s stint there with Stannis, it was a gloomy place full of thwarted ambition and Iron Throne claims that echoed in the halls of the great castle to little effect. While there are fewer immolations these days, it\u2019s otherwise just as cheery as it was in the Stannis era.On Sunday, Daenerys ended up offering Jon the dragonglass rights he craved, but it didn\u2019t change the overall tenor of the place. She ruminated over her collapsing coalition. He was despondent, per usual. (\u201cWe all enjoy what we\u2019re good at,\u201d Dany told him. \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he responded.) Looking for Something to Watch Tonight? There are more than 1000 suggestions for what to stream over on Watching, The New York Times\u2019s TV and movie recommendation site. \u00bb Even Tyrion was laid low by events, though he remained self-aware enough to know that he can\u2019t pull it off as well as others. \u201cYou look a lot better brooding than I do,\u201d he told Jon. I\u2019m pretty sure his response was a rueful approximation of a smile.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyToo bad you can\u2019t mine angst.A Few Thoughts While We Enjoy the Thorns\u2022 That was quite the sayonara from Lady Olenna, who left the show with a final kiss-off to Cersei that sowed even more doubt in Jaime about his sister-lover\u2019s future. \u201cShe\u2019ll be the end of you,\u201d she told him. I\u2019m traveling this week, so ended up watching the episode at a bar in Vancouver, and Olenna\u2019s vulgar indictment of Joffrey and spiteful confession \u2014 \u201cI want her to know it was me\u201d \u2014 brought the most raucous cheers of the night.

How have you been? Sansa asked. I am the Three-eyed Raven, her little brother responded. I see everything at all times. I saw you in your wedding dress as the snow fell on one of the worst days of your life. Um yeah, Sansa said. I\u2019ve got stuff to do. \u2026\u2022 Littlefinger gave Sansa a few bullet points from his upcoming self-help hit, \u201cHow to Outflank Rivals and Destroy People.\u201d Fight every battle everywhere, always. Everyone is your enemy. Everyone is your friend. It was his most authentic expression yet of his power-hungry worldview, and the latest sign that his Sansa-wooing campaign is sincere and won\u2019t be ending anytime soon. We\u2019ll see what Arya thinks about it, assuming she\u2019s still on her way to Winterfell.\u2022 So all it takes to thrill the crowds in King\u2019s Landing is to lead a few women through the streets for them to spit on, huh? Nice place. Somewhere in that scene was a message about demagogues and the fickle bloodlust of the plebes, one reinforced by Jaime (\u201cthe same mob spat on my sister\u201d). But I didn\u2019t really buy it. In general the show tends to use the King\u2019s Landing citizenry as a sort of dial-a-rabble shortcut whenever it wants to signal something about someone, whether it\u2019s Cersei\u2019s shame or Joffrey\u2019s unpopularity \u2014 remember his Season 2 dung facial? \u2014 or Euron\u2019s emergence as a player.PhotoDiana Rigg in \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dCredit Helen Sloan/HBO \u2022 I was, however, satisfied to hear that state propaganda had supplied an explanation for Cersei\u2019s Season 6 Sept explosion. It was \u201ca tragic accident,\u201d she told the Iron Banker. As commenters have noted, it was a pretty big plot detail to just have sitting there unexplained. I was surprised Cersei didn\u2019t blame her inside-job act of terrorism on some external enemy, which is Tyranny 101.\u2022 I believe we got the first confirmation on Sunday that the non-Drogon dragons actually have names. They are called Viserion and Rhaegal, named for Dany\u2019s brothers, which I take to mean that one is a feckless chucklehead and the other is secretly Jon Snow\u2019s dad.\u2022 Melisandre wasn\u2019t around to explain to Daenerys Jon Snow\u2019s Christlike tendencies, because it would just be too awkward to face Davos. Which is narratively convenient, but also somewhat plausible. I was more intrigued by her latest prophesy, though Varys was understandably more concerned. \u201cI have to die in this strange country,\u201d she told him. \u201cJust like you.\u201d\u2022 Samwell Tarly saved a man\u2019s life and was rewarded with more clerical duties, charged with making copies of rotting scrolls as Jorah rode off for uncertain Khaleesi-serving adventures. Take heart, Sam: As Jon Snow, Arya and the Karate Kid learned before you, the road to heroism is paved with garbage chores.\u2022 The slave trade has entered a downturn, the Iron Banker lamented to Cersei. Never fear, Mycroft \u2014 I hear it\u2019s making a comeback.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story\u2022 What did you think? Were you sickened by Cersei\u2019s cruelty? Impressed by her maneuvering? Surprised by her pledge to Euron? (\u201cYou shall have what your heart desires when the war is won.\u201d) Please share your thoughts in the comments. Correction: July 31, 2017 An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a character on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d She is Daenerys Targaryen, not Targrayen. It also described in error the names of two dragons. They are Viserion and Rhaegal, not Viserys and Rhaegar. Correction: July 31, 2017 An earlier version of a picture caption accompanying this article misspelled the given name of an actor on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d He is Aidan Gillen, not Aiden.
