Part of what makes Sam Shepard\u2019s career so fascinating was his apparent ease on both sides of the camera.We\u2019ve had other playwrights become actors \u2014\u00a0Tracy Letts is probably film and TV\u2019s current leading light in that category \u2014 but Shepard wasn\u2019t merely a strong character actor; he was sexy and charismatic in a way that made him a pin-up for people who read the New York Review of Books.When he and Jessica Lange were a high-profile couple (their black-and-white Vanity Fair layout, photographed by Bruce Weber, festooned the walls of my freshman dorm room), they were instantly iconic: a more Zen-like Liz and Dick, or Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe on more equal footing.Also Read: Sam Shepard, Actor and Pulitzer Prize-Winning Playwright, Dies at 73Shepard was by no mean hitching a ride on Lange\u2019s fame, having established his own bona fides by the mid-1980s. \u201cBuried Child\u201d earned him a Pulitzer in 1979, and his authorial reputation only grew with subsequent works like \u201cFool for Love\u201d and \u201cTrue West.\u201d (The latter play was seen by millions when PBS\u2019s \u201cAmerican Playhouse\u201d aired a TV adaptation in 1984, starring John Malkovich and Gary Sinise as two battling brothers.)Playwrights don\u2019t generally become household names outside of Broadway circles, but Shepard was becoming well known to moviegoers with striking acting turns in films like Terence Malick\u2019s 1979 \u201cDays of Heaven\u201d and the biopic \u201cFrances\u201d (where he met Lange), not to mention his Oscar-nominated performance as pilot Chuck Yeager in \u201cThe Right Stuff.\u201d Shepard had become enough of a selling point as an actor \u2014 carrying with him a craggy, no-nonsense brand of laconic American toughness \u2014 that he was cast in the lead role of Robert Altman\u2019s screen adaptation of \u201cFool for Love.\u201dAlso Read: Hollywood Remembers Sam Shepard: 'All the Best Plays Are Sam Shepard Plays'(Naturally, the ever-snotty Spy magazine couldn\u2019t resist taking a dig at Shepard\u2019s two branches of fame; a writer there once sniffed that Shepard thought he was Gary Cooper crossed with Eugene O\u2019Neill when he was really a mix of Randolph Scott and Zane Grey.)The writing slowed down in the last several decades of his life, but the acting roles continued, with Shepard excelling both in leads and supporting performances. Spy\u2019s opinion notwithstanding, there was something very Gary Cooper-ish about Shepard\u2019s handsome, rugged features and his ability to convey a great deal of emotion with a minimum of dialogue.Younger audiences who grew up watching \u201cBaby Boom\u201d on HBO loved Shepard as Diane Keaton\u2019s knight in flannel armor, and many obits have cited his roles in \u201cBlack Hawk Down\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cBloodline,\u201d but he leaves behind a rich legacy of acting work. If you\u2019re in the mood for some deeper cuts, check out Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff\u2019s 1991 \u201cVoyager\u201d or the Kathy Bates-directed \u201cDash and Lilly,\u201d where Shepard plays Dashiell Hammett opposite Judy Davis\u2019 Lillian Hellman. (And there are some lovely Shepard-Lange moments in \u201cCrimes of the Heart.\u201d)Writer, actor, musician (he had an affair with Patti Smith in the early 1970s and later played banjo on her cover of \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d), Shepard was a talented hyphenate who kept creating all the way up to his passing this weekend after a bout with ALS. Whether crafting his own words or performing those written by others, he was an extraordinary American artist.Sam Shepard's 22 Best Roles, From 'The Right Stuff' to 'Bloodline' (Photos)Sam Shepard, who died July 27 from complications of ALS, had an extensive list of acting credits, on top of being a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and author of short stories and essays.
