However, many have accused creator Seth MacFarlane of getting desperate for viewers during the past couple of seasons. The calls for Family Guy to be canceled have been going on since 2013. WhatCulture was one of the sites that criticized the show.\u201cBut, having been running for almost a decade since its initial cancellation, is it time to call it quits for real? Has the show lost its edge and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 its humor, and does MacFarlane even care anymore?\u201dThe article gives reasons why Family Guy should be canceled, including the much-heard criticism that the jokes stopped being original and the belief that Seth MacFarlane seems to be just phoning things in. Since 2013, the show has relied on shocking stunts that have upset even longtime Family Guy fans.This past weekend, a trailer for the 16th season of Family Guy debuted. Needless to say, it\u2019s quite eye catching. In the preview clip, we see Meg and Chris brutally attacking the entire school after some social justice warrior kids tried to get them taken out of the school canteen after Brian wrote an insensitive tweet. There are other Family Guy preview clips, including one of Peter looping on a roller coaster while eating his own vomit, a man pretending to be a waiter while trying to \u201cgo down\u201d on Peter, and a clip including the late Adam West.Needless to say, the clip inspired some mixed responses in the comments section after the YouTube preview video.\u201cI want it to end soon. most of the current episodes aren\u2019t good. and future ones will be terrible, I just want it to end while it\u2019s alright,\u201d claimed YouTube commenter ScoffSlaphead72.Mila Kunis plays the controversial character Meg. [Image by Mark Davis/Getty Images]\u201cThe show just gets more desperate each season. It\u2019s really time to pull the plug,\u201d said MarioLoverforu.However, there were also some commenters who thought the clips were funny. A lot of them seemed to like that the show was really taking on SJW culture. Others thought that based on the clips, there would certainly be a Season 17 on the way as well.The response on Twitter has been mixed as well.#familyguy is just getting worse and worse. Season 16 looks awful. JUST STOP IT ALREADY!\u2014 Eric Boella (@ericboella) July 28, 2017Family Guy just isn't funny anymore. The new season looks like crap.\u2014 Prince Rules (@PrinceMyBaby3) July 28, 2017Some think creator Seth MacFarlane just doesn\u2019t care about the show anymore.

West was so versatile that Callaghan was able to give him a variety of lines.Season 16 of Family Guy will premiere on Sunday, September 25. Although the show\u2019s acclaim has decreased, one can bet that Season 16 certainly won\u2019t be the last.[Featured Image by Steven Senne/AP Images]Now Read This: Farrah Abraham Debuts Red Hair For Her Crazy Horse III Party [Photo] Share 79 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 ContributorDaryl DeinoTags: adam west, family guy, seth macfarlaneJuly 19, 20155-Year-Old Dressed As Batman Rescues Toddler Trapped Inside Scorching Car [Video]July 19, 2015Chestnut Foal Born With White Patch That Looks Exactly Like Another Horse CommentsLATEST HEADLINESA 20-Year-Old Model Drugged, Put In Suitcase By Lukasz Pawel Herba, Kept For 7 Days, Let Go For Being A MomSUFFOCATING VENEZUELA: MADURO\u2019S FRAGILE STATEJay Leno\u2019s Car Collection: Leno\u2019s 1000 HP 1965 Ford Mustang Is Controversial And \u2018Vicious\u2019 [Opinion]\u2018Big Brother 19\u2019 Spoilers: Current HOH Reveals True Target For Eviction To Live Feed CamerasMolly Roloff Wedding Details: Where To Find Pictures, Video, And Updates From Saturday\u2019s Big EventStone Cold Steve Austin Reveals The One Dream Match He Came Close To Having, But Never DidAlan Greenspan Warns \u2018Abnormally Low Interest Rates\u2019 Will Collapse Bond MarketFormer Facebook Executive Antonio Garcia Martinez Predicts Collapse Of Civilization Within 30 Years\u2018Fixer Upper\u2019 News: Chip Gaines Addresses Rumors He Is Splitting From JoannaAttendees Encouraged To Bring Guns To Jim Bob Duggar\u2019s Next Public Speaking Event Never miss a story get the latest viral news to your inboxDelivered To Your INBOXNever miss a story get the latest viral news to your inbox Email AddressOr follow us onlineFacebookTwitterGoogle-plusRss Trending Stories Donald Trump To Prison?
