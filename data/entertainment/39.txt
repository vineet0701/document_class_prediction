TV-produced family-friendly sitcoms that ran on ABC in the late 1980s and \u201890s.Hulu has licensed all episodes of the original \u201cFull House,\u201d which was revived by Netflix last year as \u201cFuller House,\u201d as well as \u201cFamily Matters,\u201d \u201cStep By Step,\u201d \u201cPerfect Strangers\u201d and \u201cHangin\u2019 With Mr. Cooper.\u201d The shows will become available on Hulu on Sept. 29.The streaming giant plans to promote the shows as a block to promote multigenerational viewing, as well as to introduce the shows to younger audiences. The block that ABC branded \u201cTGIF\u201d had a successful run with a blend of G-rated family- and youth-focused comedies that have become pop culture touchstones.The deal for more than 800 episodes of \u201cTGIF\u201d sitcoms \u2014 dubbed internally as \u201cTGIH\u201d (H for Hulu) \u2014 comes on the heels of Hulu stepping up its pursuit of rerun rights to hot recent shows such as NBC\u2019s \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d Starz\u2019s \u201cPower,\u201d Showtime\u2019s \u201cHomeland\u201d and FX\u2019s \u201cAtlanta.\u201dThe licensing of the \u201cTGIF\u201d shows as a group reflects Hulu\u2019s efforts to carefully curate the library offerings in its vast archive of shows. With so many linear and digital platforms vying for viewer attention, the streamer has to look for ways to stand out and appeal to potential new subscribers.\u201cWe\u2019re really focused on having not only really excellent and interesting content but in presenting it to the users in an interesting way,\u201d said Lisa Holme, Hulu\u2019s VP of content acquisitions. \u201cThe average consumer has more access to more content at their fingertips than they have ever had in human history.\u201dHulu began its pursuit of the \u201cTGIF\u201d block a few years ago, but it took Warner Bros. a long time to wind up existing contracts with linear TV outlets to make the shows available en masse for SVOD licensing, Holme said. Netflix was a contender against Hulu for the \u201cFull House\u201d library \u2014 no surprise given its investment in \u201cFuller House\u201d \u2014 but Hulu\u2019s pitch to recreate \u201cTGIF\u201d was a compelling sell to the studio. This deal marks the first time \u201cFull House\u201d will be available on any streaming service.\u00a0Hulu has also had success with its acquisitions of classics such as \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and \u201cThe Golden Girls.\u201d (The show that Holme is aggressively chasing at present: \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\u201d)The heightened focus on vintage series curation also comes as Hulu has gained traction with its original series, notably \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d The dystopian drama toplined by Elisabeth Moss grabbed 13 Emmy nominations and is seen as a front-runner in the drama series heat as well as lead actress for Moss.The mix of originals, newer off-network hits and vintage favorites is an effort to make Hulu an indispensable service to a range of consumers and tastes. Programming efforts are always viewed with an eye toward how many members of a typical household a show might draw.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019re talking about \u2018Full House\u2019 and \u2018Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 in the same sentence \u2014 but these are stories that stand out and serve different needs,\u201d said Craig Erwich, Hulu\u2019s senior VP of content. \u201cSometimes people are in the mood for something that is very new and challenging, and sometimes people want something comfortable. Our job is to have the shows that feed those experiences.\u201d(Pictured: \u201cFull House\u201d and \u201cPerfect Strangers\u201d)Filed Under:Family MattersFull HouseHuluTCA Want to read more articles like this one?SUBSCRIBE TO VARIETY TODAY.Post A Comment7 TV\u2018Mad Men\u2019 Stars Join Matthew Weiner Amazon SeriesTV\u2018Thrones\u2019 New Episode Leaks, Not Connected to HBO HackTV\u2018Karate Kid\u2019 Sequel Series Heads to YouTube RedTV\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Recasts Owen\u2019s Sister for Season 14Oscars: Venice, Telluride, Toronto Lineups Provide Awards Season Snapshot\u2018Detroit\u2019: Annapurna\u2019s Pulse-Pounding Debut Release Aims for Oscar GoldChristopher Nolan\u2019s \u2018Dunkirk\u2019 Is the First Slam-Dunk Oscar Contender of 2017\u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 Scores Hulu Its First Big Emmy NominationsVariety JobsCreative Development CoordinatorTriptyk Studios, New York, New YorkAccount/Project Coordinator (Ad Agency)Petrol Advertising, Burbank, CaliforniaMedia SpecialistBridgewater Associates, Westport, ConnecticutExecutive Director, Aspen FilmCompany Confidential, Aspen, ColoradoAssociate Director, YouTuber & Gamer PartnershipsSave the Children, Fairfield, ConnecticutSee More Jobs MarketplaceLeave a Reply 7 Comments Cancel reply Comments are moderated.

Chuy says: July 28, 2017 at 11:03 am I\u2019m waiting for a streaming provider to purchase a Saturday morning cartoons block!Reply Alex Wells (@BadGurl404) says: July 27, 2017 at 9:13 pm Not just \u201cSabrina, The Teenage Witch\u201d but also \u201cBoy Meets World\u201d. (Although, I doubt CBS and Disney will relinquish streaming rights for those shows.).Reply Ruth says: July 27, 2017 at 8:54 pm This block beats all the other new BS on TV by miles. Good job Hulu. Rather watch this any day than yet another Sondra Rhimes show or something to promote \u2018the agenda.\u2019Reply Danny Gee says: July 27, 2017 at 6:54 pm Now we just need that Three\u2019s Company, Too Close For Comfort block.Reply Marsha says: July 27, 2017 at 6:28 pm Amazing. But what about Sabrina the teenage witch? That was TGIF as wellReply George says: July 27, 2017 at 6:09 pm Okay, somebody over at Hulu is a genius. The major networks are run by dumb monkeys but Hulu and Netflix rule because of smart decisions like this. OUTSTANDING news, and a great idea. Can\u2019t wait.Reply Sean says: July 27, 2017 at 3:19 pm The 12 year old in me is freaking out over this!!
