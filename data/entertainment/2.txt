Yes, he himself is the source of most of the leaks. William Shatner Slams SJWs - Says 'Snowflakes' \"Stand For Inequality\" And \"Misandry\" by Tyler Durden Jul 31, 2017 11:35 PM 0SHARESWilliam Shatner, the actor who famously portrayed Captain James Kirk in the original 1960s run of Star Trek spoke out against his progressive critics, claiming that SJWs \u201cstand for inequality\u201d while defending his use of terms like \u201csnowflake\u201d and \u201cmisandry\u201d \u2013 a phenomenon that angry feminists insist has been extinguished in modern society.Shatner, a Canadian citizen who\u2019s publicly empathized with the far-right and President Donald Trump, has repeatedly feuded with Trekkies who feel that he has turned away from the show\u2019s culturally-progressive message (Star Trek made television history by broadcasting television\u2019s first interracial kiss, between Shatner and castmate Nichelle Nichols). The actor often calls out examples of what he considers to be unwarranted attacks on men.SJW's can have political views but it's usually where they need to be superior in socio-economic terms. https://t.co/lLfPj6w6gV\u2014 William Shatner (@WilliamShatner) July 31, 2017\u00a0\u00a0And this is your failure of logic. SJWs stand for inequality, where they are superior to any one else hence my use of Misandry and Snowflake https://t.co/8uBGuFFM7a\u2014 William Shatner (@WilliamShatner) July 31, 2017\u00a0\u00a0All of that is true. I also use words like snowflake and misandry. What's your point sunshine? https://t.co/3Z0Zj1USIX\u2014 William Shatner (@WilliamShatner) July 31, 2017\u00a0Shatner\u2019s signature was notably absent from a February letter sent by the original Star Trek cast condemning President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cracism and bigotry.\"At least one liberal critic accused the actor of \u201ctarnishing\u201d Star Trek\u2019s legacy with his \u201calt-right language,\u201d according to Gizmodo.\"\u2018It seems that Shatner has not so much misunderstood the source material than turned away from it,\u2019 Manu Saadia, author of Trekonomics: The Economics of Star Trek.\u00a0\u2018Star Trek is the lone TV show that has carried the torch of equality, progress, and utopia in popular culture. To see one of its most famous ambassador using alt-right language should be a wake up call to fans,\u2019 Saadia continued.\u00a0\u2018It is ruinous for the 50-year-old franchise, especially so close to the launch of its first new show in more than a decade. Shatner is known to be prickly and jealous of his status in Star Trek. Maybe he can\u2019t stand that the limelights are now trained on a new, diverse crew?\u2019 said Saadia.\u201dAccording to Saadia, the show tacitly endorsed socialistic policies, like the notion that wealth should be evenly distributed throughout the population.\u201cStar Trek is a lot of things but, at its heart it stands for the ideal that the fruits of technological and social progress should be equally shared among all of humanity. That\u2019s definitely not what Shatner is advocating here,\u201d said Saadia.Funny, that wasn\u2019t our interpretation.\u00a0Donald Trump Printer-friendly versionJul 31, 2017 11:35 PM157 Comment viewing optionsFlat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expandedDate - newest firstDate - oldest first10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per pageSelect your preferred way to display the comments and click \"Save settings\" to activate your changes.TeamDepends Jul 31, 2017 11:38 PMPC's dead, Jim.Manthong TeamDepends Jul 31, 2017 11:41 PM Oh\u2026 oh \u00a0\u00a0oh\u2026My absolute favoritehttps://youtu.be/_KvO-8IvoCIBilly the Poet Manthong Jul 31, 2017 11:44 PM(Star Trek made television history by broadcasting television\u2019s first interracial kiss, between Shatner and castmate Nichelle Nichols).\u00a0That's been repeated a thousand times and no one ever points out that Kirk and Uhura were forced to kiss by aliens using mind control in order to shame them.NidStyles Billy the Poet Jul 31, 2017 11:45 PMBoth literally and figuratively...TeamDepends NidStyles Jul 31, 2017 11:50 PMDamned Ferengi....Theta_Burn TeamDepends Aug 1, 2017 12:06 AMKirk OUT...Creative_Destruct Theta_Burn Aug 1, 2017 3:06 AM\"...at its heart it stands for the ideal that the fruits of technological and social progress should be equally shared among all of humanity.\"That interpretation of the show that is about warm and fuzzy ABSOLUTE equality is a stretch, to say the least. Star Trek was \"the final frontier\", where typically homo sapiens is incentivized to explore the frontier ( or indulge in any other \"Enterprise\") by the incentives of personal gain...When everyone shares the \"fruits\" absolutely equally, people loose the incentive to PRODUCE the fruits.After all, the damn ship WAS called the \"ENTERPRISE\" for cryin' out loud!!!!\u00a0Murderface Creative_Destruct Aug 1, 2017 7:19 AMPilgrims were almost wiped out from starvation and exposure when they first arrived due to the socialist, redistribution concept of \"from those who have to those who need'. No one wanted to struggle and work grow food just for it to be forcibly taken away. Thank God for the local Indian tribes who fed and saved them those first years until they forced themselves to a more merit based, capitalistic bartering system where they could sell the products of their labor instead of having them taken and given away. No one wanted to produce in redistribution ecosystem.

Captain Kirk was an authoritarian misogynist who broke whatever rules needed to accomplish the mission. Cpt. Kirk was the original Leeroy Jenkins. He only gained perspective afterwards and usually with Spock's prodding.Moustache Rides Mr. Universe Aug 1, 2017 12:23 AMHe wasn't a misogynist.\u00a0 He didn't hate women.\u00a0 I would argue that he loved women very much.\u00a0 The rest of your post is utter horseshit too.\u00a0 Kirk had many monologues throughout the series that were very impressive from a philosophical standpoint.\u00a0 In fact, Kirk schooled Spock many a'times about the complexities of the human condition.\u00a0Did you ever watch the show?TeamDepends Moustache Rides Aug 1, 2017 12:26 AMYeah, and the Vulcan mating ritual was more than a little fucked up and violent.Manthong TeamDepends Aug 1, 2017 12:39 AM\u00a0God,,, having not watched television in a decade or so \u2026.

While most agree Kirk was at his knighthood best in \"City on the edge\" I think the best episode was \"All our Yesterdays\"Mr. Atoz: You are evidently a suicidal maniac.

Essentially a James Bond character with supporting crew and a starship.Man could do no wrong and always got the girl.Not a misogynist - a legend of sci-fi fiction.Mr. Universe Victor von Doom Aug 1, 2017 10:12 AMOk, so it wasn't so much Kirk (although he had his moments) but Gene Roddenberry and the whole show.Victor von Doom Mr. Universe Aug 2, 2017 6:46 AMI can see what you are trying to get at, but I have to strongly disagree. Treating women as women is not misogynistic - it's both natural and healthy. Treating men and women the same, as if they were the same is both unnatural and a sign of cultural (and mental) sickness.Like it or not we are biological life forms with actual (not appropriated) genders. This means we have biological drives. The West has abandoned the embracement of these drives in favour of Socialistic Utopian dreams - turning our \"society\" into a living nightmare and effectively ending the family unit.Women have their place. So do men. Disliking this fact does not make it less so. Abandoning or distaining this fact can only lead to our people's doom - which is where we have been headed since at least the 60's.Mementoil Manthong Aug 1, 2017 12:33 AMThat's gold *pressed* latinum.I always wondered about their choice of words when trying to invent a fictional currency.They claimed repeatedly throughout the series that gold is ubiquitous and quite worthless in the ST universe, but couldn't come up with a name for their currency other than Gold and Platinum. I guess that the value of the precious metals is too deeply ingrained in the human psyche.markl Mementoil Aug 1, 2017 12:49 AMDid you know there's enough gold in the earth's core to plate the entire earth twelve feet deep?Manthong markl Aug 1, 2017 12:56 AMyes... but good luck trying to get it up from the gravity, temperature and the pressure...dense asteroids might be easier.Manthong Mementoil Aug 1, 2017 12:58 AM\"pressed\"/ laced crud.. that was just from (faulty) memory.....but the Ferengi, to their credit, kept metal as a store of value in a world with replicators.To their credit also, they kept their females nude and were into ears.Jim in MN Billy the Poet Jul 31, 2017 11:50 PMNot to mention that the whole show basically was a rip on 'The Sand Pebbles' AKA gunboat diplomacy.Nice to 'honor diversity' while orbiting with a shitload of advanced weapons and all the provisions you can replicate....Billy the Poet Jim in MN Aug 1, 2017 12:00 AMNot that the author intended it that way (or didn't) but there's plenty of libertarian ideas in The Sand Pebbles. Holman breaks rice bowls all around as he seeks realistic solutions to technical dilemmas and life's problems.TeamDepends Jim in MN Aug 1, 2017 12:18 AMSulu (reporting from Planet ManPole): I don't appreciate your hateful, bigoted rhetoric one bit, Captain.\u00a0 I shall not be beaming aboard anytime soon.\u00a0 Oh MY.....Moustache Rides TeamDepends Aug 1, 2017 12:26 AMLmao...a Smudge by any... Jim in MN Aug 1, 2017 12:34 AMNot to mention that Kirk regularly defied orders, imposed himself on multiple peoples, used weapons with glee and never got fired for it. Not just a rampant individualist but part of a continued global (now universal) expansionist military empire.Now if we can toss all that and just bring back the miniskirt. And when women's empowerment meant they liked to fuck like bunnies.Mr. Universe a Smudge by any other name Aug 1, 2017 1:19 AMWell said.Pernicious Gold... a Smudge by any other name Aug 1, 2017 2:44 AMMy understanding is organizations like NOW are perfectly happy to cover for Bill Clinton, the rapist with Alzheimer's.shoWTHyme Billy the Poet Aug 1, 2017 12:54 AM\"(Star Trek made television history by broadcasting television\u2019s first interracial kiss, between Shatner and castmate Nichelle Nichols).\u00a0That's been repeated a thousand times and no one ever points out...\"\u00a0Well, some people point out it wasn't the first.
