Look, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a good guy. Some people do,\" Reznor said he told his six-year-old son of the president. \"I don't think he believes in science and I don't think he believes people should be treated decently and I don\u2019t think he tells the truth. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t like him.\"Reznor added his true thoughts about Trump in adult language. \"It's tough, because the president of the United States is a complete fucking moron,\" he added. \"That's what gets me the most \u2014 that he's this vulgar, grotesque dope, everything I hate in people.\"This isn't the first time Reznor has spoke out against Trump.\u00a0In October 2016, the singer admitted he enjoyed watching the Republican presidential debates because \"it's kind of fun to see a grenade go off and see these guys \u2013 I hate every one of them \u2013 be eliminated and humiliated.\" However, it \"stopped being fun\" and started getting \"surreal\" once Trump won the nomination.Reznor told the Village Voice that, growing up in rural, conservative-leaning Pennsylvania, he could understand how people outside of cities could feel marginalized and therefore align with someone like Trump.\"When you\u2019re not in an urban environment, you often feel left out of the conversation, and I get that,\" Reznor said of his Rust Belt roots. \"I grew up in that.\" Still, he called the current situation in America \"disheartening.\"More NewsTrent Reznor Announces Trilogy of Nine Inch Nails EPsTrent Reznor to Score Leonardo DiCaprio's Documentary 'Before the Flood'Trent Reznor Calls Donald Trump Candidacy 'Absurd'All Stories Don\u2019t Miss a StorySign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.Please enable javascript to sign up for the newsletter.
