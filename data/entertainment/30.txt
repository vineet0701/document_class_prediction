Music 1 0 0 July 29, 2017 Katy Perry: Will Hosting Gig At MTV VMAs Revive Her Career? Daryl DeinoKaty Perry is one of the biggest pop music icons of the past 10 years. However, unless you\u2019ve been under a rock, it\u2019s hard to deny that 2017 has been a bad year for Ms. Perry. It started decently with the release of her single \u201cChained To The Rhythm,\u201d which hit the top five on Billboard\u2018s Hot 100. At the time, Billboard gave the song a really positive review.\u201cKaty Perry is now a political pop star! That\u2019s what \u2018Chained To The Rhythm\u2019 \u2014 her highly anticipated new single released on Friday (Feb. 10), to be performed at the 59th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday night \u2014 aims to declare with undisguised pride.\u201dThe review praised the shimmering production and the lyrics that criticize us for being tone deaf. It debuted high on the charts but soon dropped. It was still considered a hit, and that\u2019s something that certainly can\u2019t be said for everything else the pop icon released this year, including her album Witness.Her follow-up singles \u201cBon App\u00e9tit,\u201d and \u201cSwish Swish\u201d were both critical and commercial flops. Perry\u2019s album Witness also received mediocre reviews, debuted on top of the charts, and then fell off instantly. Many believed that she was trying too hard to be relevant. Chris DeVille of Stereogum was just one of Perry\u2019s critics.Katy Perry\u2019s \u2018Witness\u2019 album campaign has been a disaster. [Image by Christopher Polk/Getty Images]\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until Perry began rolling out Witness that her opportunistic try-hard tendencies began to drown out the music. That\u2019s partially because she has seemed especially desperate this go-round but mostly because the music has been bad.\u201dDeVille added that Perry seemed to be trying to throw everything at the kitchen sink to see what sticks and not much did. Perhaps Perry\u2019s latest gig will change that. The Los Angeles Times has the news.\u201cThe MTV Video Music Awards are returning to California and getting a certified \u2018California Gurl [sic]\u2019 to host. Katy Perry took to her Twitter feed Thursday to announce her upcoming gig hosting \u2013 and performing \u2013 at the VMAs in August.\u201dKaty Perry Tabbed To Host #VMAs https://t.co/P77qZOHnJn\u2014 Q92.3 (@Q923waterloo) July 29, 2017After an article about Perry\u2019s future hosting gig on Billboard, many of the commenters don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u201cLooks like a snooze fest. I\u2019ll skip this one,\u201d says Craigypants.\u201cWith how she acts and what she says now, it\u2019ll be cringy. Then again, the last time I\u2019ve watched VMAs was in 2010 (?), so I don\u2019t really care,\u201d claims Breakout.Still, some on Twitter are excited.SOOO excited @katyperry is hosting the @MTV VMA's.
