They\u2019d heard about the Check It gang from local radio DJ Ronald \u201cMo\u201d Moten while researching a documentary on go-go, the raw, indigenous Washington DC music genre. \u201cHe said these kids are like nobody you\u2019ve ever met,\u201d says Flor. The go-go doc was soon abandoned. Trouble Funk would have to wait.The Check It are the first documented, gay American street gang to make it to film. They were formed in 2009 in the footfall of Barack Obama\u2019s White House, in response to escalating homophobic crime in the US capitol, by a crew of black ninth-graders who decided to fight back.\u201cI want the world to see another side of DC,\u201d says Flor, looking back to the germination of Check It, the arresting feature that sprung from Moten\u2019s introduction and bowed to rapturous applause at last year\u2019s Tribeca film festival in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s not the White House. The Check It embody so many of our failures as a nation.\u201d Facebook Twitter Pinterest Watch the trailer for Check It.After the Moonlight fades: what's next for LGBT cinema Read moreSome of the Check It go to the same public school as Flor\u2019s teenage kids. \u201cIt is so shameful to me,\u201d she says, \u201cthat this could go on in a city that is very wealthy and well educated. There are countless organisations that are funding programmes across the world while failing to see what is directly under our noses.\u201dIn Check It, a familiarly cinematic gay narrative of victimhood and bullying is wrestled back by the gang, an elastic cooperative of whip-smart 14-22-year-olds who spring to one another\u2019s defence at the ping of a WhatsApp alert. They are known and feared in the economically deprived Ward 8 district for carrying ice-picks in their clutch-bags. Most are disenfranchised by the state, church, school and family, the hard details of which they share to camera. Many have a string of drug and sex-work-related convictions. \u201cThey are the marginalised of the marginalised,\u201d notes Oppenheimer, \u201cforgotten by everyone. When you\u2019re with them day in, day out, you see how their wiring has been so fucked with on so many levels.\u201dThe film follows a select bunch of the tenacious Check It gang as they are put through their paces at a local fashion camp and taught the rigours of the boxing ring, maximising their self-taught strengths, finding a bittersweet spot somewhere between Raging Bull and RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. Oppenheimer and Flor\u2019s feature is made with the same maternal eye that Jennie Livingston cast over the vogueing scene in 1990\u2019s evergreen documentary Paris Is Burning, and carries a dose of the tart wit of recent LA transgender travelogue Tangerine. \u201cThey\u2019re about having the courage to be who you are in spite of great peril,\u201d says Flor. \u201cThey really do lay their lives on the line every day they wake up and walk down the street.\u201d Facebook Twitter Pinterest Gang related ... Check It directors Dana Flor and Toby Oppenheimer.Why TV could teach cinema a lesson about how to treat trans characters Read moreBecause it falls into a world of Black Lives Matter and domestic LGBT activism on the presidential doorstep, Check It is very much its own work. \u201cTo be honest,\u201d says Flor, \u201cit saddens me how little has changed. The Check It are very much still on the margins of all that. They don\u2019t get support from anyone.\u201dAfter the producers put out a funding call in 2015, Steve Buscemi was introduced to Check It by his production partner. He sent Flor back a three-letter text message after seeing the trailer: \u201cWTF?\u201d Buscemi told comic Louis CK about the film while the two were filming online sitcom Horace and Pete. And because CK\u2019s own work walks a similar line between sadness and joy, he has joined its famous fans: you can stream the film on CK\u2019s website. Meanwhile, the ribbon-snipping ceremony on a bricks-and-mortar Check It shop, selling fashions crafted by the partially reformed gang, was performed earlier this year by Washington\u2019s mayor, Muriel Bowser. The political establishment is beginning to notice, while Flor and Oppenheimer remain committed to their cast.\u201cTo say that a bunch of white, middle-aged film-makers hanging out with a black gay gang is chill, and they never noticed?\u201d quizzes Flor. \u201cNo. We really stand out. But as film-makers, what you want to do is to dive into that world. You have to make sure they believe they are not having a story imposed on them. I\u2019m not being objective here. I care really strongly for them. I am intimately tied to the Check It. These kids are my heroes.\u201dCheck It is available to stream now on louisck.netTopicsFilmShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content View all comments >Order by newestoldestrecommendationsShow 252550100AllThreads collapsedexpandedunthreadedLoading comments\u2026 Trouble loading?View more commentsmore on this storyThe reissue racket: how many more \u2018classic\u2019 albums will be repackaged?Mediocre records such as Interpol\u2019s Our Love to Admire used to be forgotten.
