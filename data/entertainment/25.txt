Theron portrays a top-level British spy dispatched to Berlin to take down an espionage ring. David Leitch, the co-director of \u201cJohn Wick,\u201d helmed the movie. James McAvoy, John Goodman, Til Schweiger, Eddie Marsan, Sofia Boutella, and Toby Jones also star.\u201cAtomic Blonde\u201d scored similarly to Fox\u2019s \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service,\u201d which took in\u00a0 $1.4 million on its way to a $36.2 million opening weekend on Feb. 13-15, 2015.\u201cThe Emoji Movie\u201d expands to 4,069 venues on Friday, with Sony projecting a $20 million debut while rival studios have forecasted as much as $30 million. The movie, which has a $50 million budget, shows the secret world inside a teen\u2019s smartphone. T.J. Miller, Maya Rudolph, Christina Aguilera, Anna Faris, James Corden, Jennifer Coolidge, Sofia Vergara, and Patrick Stewart comprise the voice cast.Critics have given a big thumbs down to \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d currently at 0% on Rotten Tomatoes, but the film\u2019s core demographic of younger children is critic-proof. Sony has been actively promoting \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d with Miller parasailing into Cannes in May to help launch the movie\u2019s first trailer, and will begin an international rollout next weekend.The second frame of Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cDunkirk\u201d could win the weekend for Warner Bros., making it the first title to go back-to-back since \u201cWonder Woman\u201d did so on June 9-11. The World War II drama topped expectations during its opening weekend, with $50.5 million, and finished its first week at $74.3 million. The studio has positioned \u201cDunkirk,\u201d which recounts the 1940 evacuation of 300,000 Allied troops from France, as an early awards season contender.Universal\u2019s second weekend of R-rated comedy \u201cGirls Trip\u201d will also be in contention after an impressive $31.2 million opening. It took in a solid $42.2 million in its first six days.Overall summer business for North America is down 7% compared with last year at $2.89 billion as of July 26 and is not likely to improve this weekend, according to Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at comScore. He pointed out that last year\u2019s comparable weekend saw the $59.2 million debut of \u201cJason Bourne\u201d and a $23.8 million opening weekend for \u201cBad Moms.\u201d\u201cThe silver lining may lie somewhere in the historically unpredictable month of August that has become a breeding ground for many a sleeper hit and a hotbed of numerous offbeat box office winners that provided late season boost to the bottom line,\u201d he added.Filed Under:Atomic BlondeDunkirkThe Emoji Movie Want to read more articles like this one?SUBSCRIBE TO VARIETY TODAY.Post A Comment19 TV\u2018Mad Men\u2019 Stars Join Matthew Weiner Amazon SeriesTV\u2018Thrones\u2019 New Episode Leaks, Not Connected to HBO HackTV\u2018Karate Kid\u2019 Sequel Series Heads to YouTube RedTV\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Recasts Owen\u2019s Sister for Season 14Oscars: Venice, Telluride, Toronto Lineups Provide Awards Season Snapshot\u2018Detroit\u2019: Annapurna\u2019s Pulse-Pounding Debut Release Aims for Oscar GoldChristopher Nolan\u2019s \u2018Dunkirk\u2019 Is the First Slam-Dunk Oscar Contender of 2017\u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 Scores Hulu Its First Big Emmy NominationsVariety JobsCreative Development CoordinatorTriptyk Studios, New York, New YorkAccount/Project Coordinator (Ad Agency)Petrol Advertising, Burbank, CaliforniaMedia SpecialistBridgewater Associates, Westport, ConnecticutExecutive Director, Aspen FilmCompany Confidential, Aspen, ColoradoAssociate Director, YouTuber & Gamer PartnershipsSave the Children, Fairfield, ConnecticutSee More Jobs MarketplaceLeave a Reply 19 Comments Cancel reply Comments are moderated.

Plus she has the acting chops to pull it off.This is unlike the recent, predictable action moves from male action stars: Cruise, the Rock, Diesel, Damon \u2026 All performed to mediocre box office returns based on the movie budgets.Reply loco73 says: July 28, 2017 at 7:41 pm Watched \u201cAtomic Blonde\u201d and really liked it. One of the best during this lame summer movie season. \u201cBaby Driver\u201d , \u201cFree Fire\u201d , \u201cI, Daniel Blake\u201d , \u201cChurchill\u201d and \u201cDunkirk\u201d have saved this year at the movies so far.Reply Leon says: July 28, 2017 at 1:33 pm You know what pisses me off. All the moves made for men are lame PG-13 and all these chick action movies are rated R. It\u2019s Bull. Make better guy movies. There is nothing wrong with being a guy and liking kick a$$ r rated movies.Reply Miss Cleo says: July 28, 2017 at 4:00 pm Gurl, please.Reply Christian says: July 28, 2017 at 3:44 pm Logan, Deadpool, the original terminator moives, Sin city, 300, total recall, the matrix, aliens, rambo, John Wick, Kung Fu Hustle, District 9, Mad Max Rury road. There is nothing wrong with being a girl and liking kick a$$ r rated movies. You can watch a movie as a guy if the movie has a female lead, it\u2019s not like it makes you any less masculine. Also you act as though an R rating makes a movie good and a PG -13 move bad even though that\u2019s a really dumb and reductive idea that has been proven wrong over and over time and time again. All you\u2019re doing when you say that a movie can\u2019t be a guy\u2019s movie with a woman being the lead is putting attention to the fact that it\u2019s a woman and making a big deal out of something that really doesn\u2019t matter as well as saying that you can\u2019t enjoy watching a movie with a woman in a role that you normally see a dude take, which is really stupid.Reply Matt Spiegel says: July 28, 2017 at 11:00 am A newspaper delivery boy should have made more this weekend than the entire Emoji Movie worldwide. If you are a parent and take your kids to this movie, shame on you.Reply Pippy says: July 28, 2017 at 10:29 am ATOMIC BLONDE and DETROIT in theaters \u2026 finally some good movies out! (DUNKIRK doesn\u2019t count)Reply Chris Christie's Belt says: July 28, 2017 at 9:29 am The fight scenes looked cheesy. She is too slow and throws long \u201cWWE style\u201d strikes.Reply filmreviewsbyrobertjamesodell says: July 29, 2017 at 6:12 am You are like the only one (there may be a few other malcontents) who have a problem with the fight scenes. The fight scenes are incredible and look authentic. Theron kills it.Reply John says: July 28, 2017 at 9:16 am I don\u2019t know about this \u201cAtomic Blonde\u201d, it looks so much like the same effort of making \u201cThe Long Kiss Goodnight\u201d, trying to extend an aging female actress\u2019 career with overloaded action. That became the beginning of the end of Geena Davis\u2019 movie career. Would it be the same for \u201cAtomic Blonde\u201d? Time will tell.Reply filmreviewsbyrobertjamesodell says: July 29, 2017 at 6:18 am Theron has done action and done it brilliantly in Fury Road. The situation bares no resemblance to The Last Kiss Goodbye. And Theron is still one of the most beautiful actresses on the silver screen today despite ageist remarks.Reply Lisa says: July 28, 2017 at 10:59 am \u2018Aging\u2019????? We have 70 year olds playing male action stars, give me a break! This woman came to Hollywood only 15 years ago with no English and no connections. She learned English better than most native born Americans and won and Oscar to boot! Smarts, strength and beauty have no expiration date!Reply filmreviewsbyrobertjamesodell says: July 29, 2017 at 6:23 am Michael Moore Truth is she is even more stunning now than when her career began. And we seem to be overlooking the most pertinent thing and that is she is a very talented actress. Michael Moore says: July 28, 2017 at 12:16 pm Lisa, while I agree the Aging comment is dumb, She is not quite as young and fresh as you make her out to be. I remember her from 2 Days in the Valley and IMDB puts that at 1996. She also came from South Africa so I believe she had a pretty good idea how to speak english, she just needed to drop the accent. Your overall point though is well taken. At 42 she is still very much sexy, attractive and at the top of her game. Pippy says: July 28, 2017 at 10:37 am ATOMIC BLONDE is way more successful at creating a compelling and believable female action hero than LONG KISS GOODNIGHT.Reply Jacob says: July 28, 2017 at 11:02 am None of these female spy movies can compare to Salt filmreviewsbyrobertjamesodell says: July 29, 2017 at 6:25 am Jolie sits at the top of females in action films.Reply loco73 says: July 28, 2017 at 7:43 pm Angelina Jolie is not even close inn\u201dSalt\u201d to what Theron does in \u201cAtomic Blonde\u201d \u2026.Reply Rex the Wonder Dog says: July 28, 2017 at 10:23 am No.ReplySee All 19 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content5 Pieces You Can Still Buy From Zara Larsson's Collaboration\u2026Fox News' Eric Bolling Suspended Pending Results Of Sexting\u2026How to Get Kate Middleton's Flawless Nude Legs & Support for\u2026This Is Us' Post-Super Bowl Episode Will Not Be a 'Standalone&#039\u2026Ta-Nehisi Coates on HBO's 'Confederate': 'Skepticism Must Be the\u2026Subscribe to Variety Today!
