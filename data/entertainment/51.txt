The 23-year-old singer was photographed talking to police officers following the reported incident. Justin hit the snapper as he was pulling his SUV out of a parking space. Police told Mirror Online that Bieber has not been arrested. A man was photographed lying on the ground in apparent pain, with his camera equipment strewn around him as the pop star tried to help and stayed with the man for around 10 minutes until paramedics and police arrived.

In a dramatic video, Justin is seen leaving the church and heading to his car as photographers snap pictures and video of him. Justin pulls his car forward and a second later, a photographer who is stood filming screams and falls to the ground. Justin gets out of his truck and runs over to the man to make sure he's okay. Kneeling down beside him, Justin reassures him and asks if he's okay and appears to ask the crowd to give the man some space. Justin can also be seen in the video talking to police officers after they arrived at the scene. The photographer was then carried away on a stretcher into a waiting ambulance.

Hope I hear different. \"Bieber was allegedly driving a black Ford F150 pickup truck, one pap jumped out of the way, another had his leg caught up in the wheel.\" While initial reports suggested that the vehicle was leased under Kourtney Kardashian's name, Beverly Hills Police Department say there is no Kardashian connection to the incident that they're aware of. TMZ reports that Justin was leaving the Saban Theater, where he'd been worshipping at a City Church event when it happened. He got a ride from a friend, while another drove his truck. Police say the photographer suffered non life-threatening injuries to his lower body. Mirror Online has contacted Justin's representatives for comment.

An Australian entertainment reporter claims that he was told by an unnamed insider that Biebs wants to \"reconnect with his faith\" and possibly start his very own church. Richard Wilkins said on Today Extra: \"I am led to believe that the real reason he has come off the road is because he wants to reconnect with his faith and he may be even planning to start his own church.\" Read MoreJustin Bieber CANCELS Purpose World Tour without explaining why - but was it to start his own church? Is Bieber going to start his own church? (Image: Getty) He cancelled his tour due to \"unforeseen circumstances\" (Image: Getty) The 23-year-old Sorry hitmaker was Down Under recently, and attended the annual Hillsong Church conference in Sydney. Richard added: \"We know that he was in the country a few weeks ago having meetings and attending the big Hillsong convention that they had here. [He's] very close to a lot of the Hillsong people. \"Whether he's looking at teaming up with them in something of a more permanent situation or doing some sort of religious activity on his own - starting his own church - we're not quite sure , but that's the word from an inside source.\" Justin's team made an official announcement about the cancellation of his tour dates on Facebook last night. It said: \"Due to unforeseen circumstances, Justin Bieber will cancel the remainder of the Purpose World Tour concerts. Justin loves his fans and hates to disappoint them. He thanks his fans for the incredible experience of the Purpose World Tour over last 18 months. \"He is grateful and honored to have shared that experience with his cast and crew for over 150 successful shows across 6 continents during this run. However, after careful consideration he has decided he will not be performing any further dates. Tickets will be refunded at point of purchase.\"Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterCelebs NewsletterFollow @mirrorcelebSubscribe to our Celebs newsletterEnter emailSubscribeCommentsShow more commentsMore OnJustin BieberCelebsallMost ReadMost RecentBig BrotherBig Brother star strongly denies drug addiction after nightclub row over cocaine spirals out of controlEllie Young has strongly denied claims made by Kayleigh Morris that she took drugs after the EOTB star took to Twitter following a disastrous club night appearanceAmir KhanFrom grinning teenager to stylish fashion icon: Faryal Makhdoom's changing look as husband Amir Khan reveals shock splitFaryal went from a demure teen to a sassy independent woman - and not all the Khans approvedMarnie SimpsonMarnie Simpson clashes with Love Island's Chris Hughes and sparks HUGE Twitter war after branding non-celebrities \"civilians\"The Geordie Shore star was bombarded with tweets from angry peopleSexual healthUsher now sued by A MAN who claims he gave him herpes - as two more women also launch lawsuitsA new lawsuit will be filed next week just weeks after it was revealed last month that the R&B star had paid out $1.1million in 2012 after it was claimed he passed her the STD.Saturday Kitchen'Hello, I have crabs': Saturday Kitchen caller mishap leaves presenter red-faced but viewers love itMatt Tebbutt and his guests were left gobsmacked when one viewer called in asking for guidance.Jesy NelsonLittle Minx!
