Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, raised the most urgent question in American politics: Is he really Larry David? The answer, most likely, is no. But the former presidential candidate and the \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" star are apparently distantly related. Sanders is a \"third cousin or something,\" David told reporters at a Television Critics Association event on Wednesday. The comedian, who impersonated the senator on \"Saturday Night Live\" during the 2016 election, said he learned about the genealogical connection while filming an upcoming episode of the PBS series \"Finding Your Roots.\" \"I was very happy about that,\" David said, according to Variety. \"I thought there must have been some connection.\" David, who scored an Emmy nomination for the spot-on impression of his fellow Brooklyn native on \"SNL,\" explained how he came to play the part. \u201cThis Bernie Sanders thing,\u201d David told reporters, according to Variety. \u201cDuring the first debate between Bernie and Hillary, [\"SNL\" creator] Lorne Michaels got emails and calls during the debate, saying that I should be doing Bernie Sanders.\u201d That's when Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel, the inspiration for Jeremy Piven's character on \"Entourage,\" stepped in to help close the deal. \"Ari Emanuel called me up and said, 'What did you think?'' And every time I watched Bernie Sanders, I would repeat everything that he said, because I know that I can talk like that. So I started talking to Ari, the agent, I started talking to him like Bernie.\u201d The rest is television history. Sanders even appeared with David in a February 2016 sketch. The \"Seinfeld\" creator played an aristocratic gentleman on a sinking ship who debates the merits of democratic socialism with the senator's rumpled commoner.
