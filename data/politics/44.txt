(AP File Photo/Carolyn Kaster) David Crary \u2014 Associated PressSign-Up for our News & Politics Newsletter\u00a0 Sign-UpNEW YORK \u2014 Faced with a firm denial from the Boy Scouts, the White House on Wednesday corrected President Donald Trump\u2019s claim in an interview that the head of the youth group called him to heap praise on a politically aggressive speech Trump delivered at the Scouts\u2019 national jamboree.After the Boy Scouts issued a statement saying no such call happened, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed their take but said \u201cmultiple members of the Boy Scout leadership\u201d approached Trump in person after the speech and \u201coffered quite powerful compliments.\u201dSanders said compliments that Trump described receiving from the Boy Scouts and the Mexican president \u00a0happened \u2014 just not on the phone, as Trump claimed.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was a lie. That\u2019s a pretty bold accusation,\u201d \u00a0Sanders told reporters. \u201cThe conversations took place, they just simply didn\u2019t take place over a phone call \u2026 he had them in person.\u201dTrump told The Wall Street Journal in an interview published Wednesday, \u201cI got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts saying it was the greatest speech that was ever made to them.\u201d\u201cWe are unaware of any such call,\u201d the Boy Scouts responded in a statement. It specified that neither Boy Scout President Randall Stephenson nor Chief Scout Executive Mike Surbaugh placed such a call.There was no immediate word from the Boy Scouts as to whether Surbaugh was among those congratulating Trump in person. Stephenson did not attend the speech.The White House also had to back off another Trump claim made Monday about an alleged phone call from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, who Trump claimed called him to praise his immigration policies.Sanders was responding to questions about a statement from the Mexican government denying what Trump described as a recent phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. Trump said earlier this week that Pena Nieto called him to praise his immigration policies.\u201cAs you know, the border was a tremendous problem and they\u2019re close to 80 percent stoppage. Even the president of Mexico called me: They said their southern border, very few people are coming because they know they\u2019re not going to get through our border, which is the ultimate compliment,\u201d Trump said Monday.Sanders said Trump had been \u201creferencing a conversation that they had had at the G-20 summit where they specifically talked about the issues that he referenced.\u201dEmail exchanges with the Boy Scouts of America head office made clear that fallout from the speech, and the president\u2019s latest claim, placed the BSA in an awkward position \u2014 seeking to show its longstanding respect for the office of the presidency and avoid a confrontation with Trump while making clear that its top leaders had not called him to praise the speech.Other U.S. presidents have delivered nonpolitical speeches at past jamborees. To the dismay of many parents and former scouts, Trump promoted his political agenda and derided his rivals, inducing some of the scouts in attendance to boo at the mention of former President Barack Obama.The Scouts noted that Surbaugh had apologized last week to members of the scouting community who were offended by the political rhetoric in Trump\u2019s July 24 speech in West Virginia.\u201cI want to extend my sincere apologies to those in our Scouting family who were offended by the political rhetoric that was inserted into the jamboree,\u201d Surbaugh said. \u201cThat was never our intent.\u201dSurbaugh noted that every sitting president since 1937 has been invited to visit the jamboree.Stephenson told The Associated Press two days after the speech that Boy Scout leaders anticipated Trump would spark controversy with politically tinged remarks, yet felt obliged to invite him out of respect for his office.Hoping to minimize friction, the Boy Scouts issued guidelines to adult staff members for how the audience should react to the speech. Any type of political chanting was specifically discouraged.Stephenson, who didn\u2019t attend Trump\u2019s speech, said the guidance wasn\u2019t followed impeccably.Associated Press writers Darlene Superville and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.Previously from Chicago News Friends of Northwestern prof, murder victim shocked by twists, turns 8 shot in Chicago since Friday afternoon NU professor, Oxford bursar sought in fatal stabbing are in custody 50 years ago, Chicago squirmed at Picasso's 'big, homely metal thing'Currently Trendingchicago newsFriends of Northwestern prof, murder victim shocked by twists, turns chicago newsNU professor, Oxford bursar sought in fatal stabbing are in custody 2017 bears training campBears Camp Digest: Starting QB Mike Glennon struggling with deep ball \u2013 Chicago Sun-Timesarchitecture & design50 years ago, Chicago squirmed at Picasso's 'big, homely metal thing' baseballReynaldo Lopez says he\u2019s ready to pitch for White Sox \u2013 Chicago Sun-Times\u00d7SearchCAPTIONPost toCancel "}
