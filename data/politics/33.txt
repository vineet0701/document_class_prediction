(ullstein bild/Getty Images) It wasn\u2019t until the media started asking questions that the White House\u2019s introduction of a law curtailing legal immigration got contentious. During the daily press briefing, CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, himself a son of Cuban immigrants, challenged senior adviser Stephen Miller on a component of the proposed bill which would grant English-speakers more favor in gaining admission to the United States. \u201cAren\u2019t you trying to change what it means to be an immigrant coming into this country if you\u2019re telling them you have to speak English?\u201d Acosta asked. \u201cCan\u2019t people learn how to speak English when they get here?\u201d The answer is, of course, that they can. As President Trump\u2019s grandfather did. As Stephen Miller\u2019s great-grandparents did. And as a member of Trump\u2019s own Cabinet did. The policy, the Raise Act, would introduce a point-based system for new applicants to enter the United States. In addition to speaking English, points would be awarded based on answers to these other questions that Miller mentioned: \u201cCan they support themselves and their families financially? Do they have a skill that will add to the U.S. economy? Are they being paid a high wage? Were that policy in place in 1885, Friedrich Trumpf would likely not have gained entry to the United States. The immigration record for his arrival that year indicates that he arrived without an identifiable \u201ccalling\u201d: The word \u201cnone\u201d sits next to his name in that column. A biographer of Trumpf \u2014 father of Fred Trump, who was the father of the president \u2014 told Deutsche Welle that Donald Trump\u2019s grandfather didn\u2019t speak English when he got here. \u201cHe came to New York,\u201d Gwenda Blair said, \u201cand, after he learnt English, he went to the West Coast, ran restaurants, amassed a nest egg, then went back to Kallstadt, married the girl next door and brought her to New York.\u201d It was on the West Coast that Trumpf (now just Trump) became a citizen and registered to vote in the 1892 election. But: no skills, no English. Would he have gotten in? Donald Trump\u2019s mother, Mary MacLeod, would have had more luck. An immigrant from Scotland, she is listed on Census documents as speaking English, although a Politico profile of her from last year notes that \u201cshe spoke almost exclusively in Scots Gaelic before leaving for a new life in the United States at age 18.\u201d Were Friedrich Trumpf barred entry, there might not be a President Trump. But if this law had been in effect a century ago, there also may not have been a senior adviser Stephen Miller. Reporter Jennifer Mendelsohn tracked down Miller\u2019s genealogy. She discovered that Miller\u2019s father\u2019s father\u2019s mother \u2014 his great-grandmother, Sarah Miller \u2014 was identified in the 1910 Census as speaking only Yiddish. What\u2019s more, the Los Angeles Times obituary for Miller\u2019s grandmother Freya makes special mention of how her parents, Nathan and Frannie Baker, \u201cepitomized the American Dream.\u201d \u201cTeaching each other English, working together to build a nest egg, the two immigrants eventually bought a small grocery store,\u201d it reads. \u201cThe Baker Family lived upstairs and all the family worked in the store. Freya, and her two brothers, were educated in the superb public school system.\u201d Other senior Trump officials have family trees that suggest ancestors who may have been barred entry at Ellis Island. Kellyanne Conway\u2019s great-grandfather was named Pasquale Lombardo and was born in Naples, Italy. A man of that name and the proper age is identified in the 1910 Census as living in Pennsylvania and working as a blast furnace laborer who spoke only Italian. Stephen K. Bannon\u2019s great-great-grandfather was a man named Mattias Herr, who was born in Bavaria in 1836 before moving to Maryland. It\u2019s not clear whether he spoke English or knew a skilled trade. Mike Pence \u2014 like many Americans \u2014 is also the grandchild of an immigrant. His mother\u2019s father, Richard Michael Cawley, immigrated to the United States from Ireland to work as a bus driver. He did speak English, though, and likely would have cleared admission under the Raise Act. As mentioned above, though, at least one member of Trump\u2019s Cabinet didn\u2019t. Elaine Chao, Trump\u2019s secretary of transportation (and wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell), was born in Taiwan and came to the United States in 1961, when she was 8. She described that transition in a CNN interview last month. \u201cI remember how tough it was to try to learn a new culture, a new language and just to adapt to, like, ordinary daily stuff like the food. Like, most Chinese don\u2019t eat meat between breads,\u201d she said. As she tried to learn the language, \u201cthe kids were mean to me,\u201d she said. Her father, who spoke English, was already in the United States when Chao and her mother and sisters arrived, working in the maritime industry. Would that have been enough to warrant admission? To bring over his family? This, it seems, was Acosta\u2019s point: Doesn\u2019t two centuries of experience show that people who arrive in America without the ability to speak English or a highly skilled trade can have a significant impact on the future of the country? Watch more! President Trump announced the Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment (RAISE) Act on Aug. 2, which aims to cut immigration by half from the current level of more than 1 million green cards granted per year.
