While the term was originally coined to refer to blatantly false news stories about the Pope endorsing Trump or Hillary Clinton murdering congressional staffers with her bare hands, Trump just flings the phrase around any time somebody says something mean about him. The fake news designation tends to be reserved for the likes of CNN, MSNBC, ABC News, and anything else you would normally hear Rush Limbaugh or Alex Jones refer to as the liberal media. On Wednesday, an unlikely new member joined the president\u2019s not-so-exclusive fake news club: Sports Illustrated.I love the White House, one of the most beautiful buildings (homes) I have ever seen. But Fake News said I called it a dump \u2013 TOTALLY UNTRUE\u2014 Donald J.
