John McCainJohn McCainMcCain expects to return to Senate next month Overnight Healthcare: Governors press Trump to make ObamaCare payments McCain: Trump's concerns with Russia sanctions bill 'misplaced' MORE (R-Ariz.) ripped President Trump's handling of the Afghanistan War on Thursday, saying the White House has failed to provide strategic guidance since Trump took office.\u00a0Less than a week after casting\u00a0the decisive vote against Trump-backed ObamaCare repeal legislation, McCain defended the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan from criticism by\u00a0Trump, saying on twitter \"Our commanders-in-chief, not our commanders in the field\" were responsible for the failure in the country.\u00a0While McCain\u00a0blamed past administrations for the problems in Afghanistan, he said in a statement that the lack \"of successful policy and strategic guidance from Washington\" had continued into the new administration.\u00a0ADVERTISEMENT\u201cI urge the President to resolve the differences within his administration as soon as possible and decide on a policy and strategy that can achieve our national security interests in Afghanistan and the region,\" McCain said.\u00a0McCain has\u00a0promised\u00a0to\u00a0provide his own strategy on the 16-year-old war, warning that he would introduce\u00a0an amendment in the annual defense policy bill if the White House fails to announce its own this\u00a0month.\u00a0\"If the President fails to do this by the time the Senate takes up the defense authorization bill in September, I will offer an amendment to that legislation which will provide such a strategy,\u201d he\u00a0said.McCain, a Vietnam War veteran who serves\u00a0as the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also defended the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen.\u00a0John Nicholson, following criticism from the president.\u201cGeneral John Nicholson has served our country with honor and distinction for 35 years. He has earned the trust and admiration of those he has served with. And he has earned my full confidence,\"\u00a0McCain said.Trump had\u00a0pushed to\u00a0fire the general during a meeting with his\u00a0national security team last month, saying the United States is \u201closing\u201d the war,\u00a0NBC News reported on Wednesday.The Republican lawmaker has not shied away from criticizing the Trump administration for its\u00a0lack of strategy\u00a0in the war-torn country.He has also bucked the administration's push on healthcare, casting\u00a0the deciding vote last week to kill a scaled-down ObamaCare repeal bill, halting healthcare reform efforts in the Senate.McCain delivered a scathing speech on the Senate floor last week before the vote, in which he slammed the closed-door process of crafting the GOP bill.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors in consultation with the administration ... asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition. I don\u2019t think that is going to work in the end. And it probably shouldn\u2019t,\" he said.
