I did not pay any attention to the details of this agreement before reading the transcript. By the time I was halfway through it, my brain could not stop screaming at Trump for his failure to understand what Turnbull was telling him.Australia has a policy of refusing to accept refugees who arrive by boat. The reason, as Turnbull patiently attempts to explain several times, is that it believes giving refuge to people who arrive by boat would encourage smuggling and create unsafe passage with a high risk of deaths at sea. But it had a large number of refugees who had arrived by sea, living in difficult conditions, whom Australia would not resettle (for fear of encouraging more boat trafficking) but whom it did not want to deport, either. The United States government agreed under President Obama to vet 1,250 of these refugees and accept as many of them as it deemed safe.In the transcript, Trump is unable to absorb any of these facts. He calls the refugees \u201cprisoners,\u201d and repeatedly brings up the Cuban boatlift (in which Castro dumped criminals onto Florida). He is unable to absorb Turnbull\u2019s explanation that they are economic refugees, not from conflict zones, and that the United States has the ability to turn away any of them it deems dangerous.Donald Trump Is His Own Worst EnemyPresident Trump's efforts to fix his headline-making crises often have the effect of making the situation worse.Turnbull tries to explain to Trump that refugees have not been detained because they pose a danger to Australian society, but in order to deter ship-based smuggling:Trump: Why haven\u2019t you let them out? Why have you not let them into your society?Turnbull: Okay, I will explain why. It is not because they are bad people. It is because in order to stop people smugglers, we had to deprive them of the product. So we said if you try to come to Australia by boat, even if we think you are the best person in the world, even if you are a Noble [sic] Prize winning genius, we will not let you in. Because the problem with the people \u2014At this point, Trump fails to understand the policy altogether, and proceeds to congratulate Turnbull for what Trump mistakes to be a draconian policy of total exclusion:Trump: That is a good idea. We should do that too. You are worse than I am \u2026 Because you do not want to destroy your country. Look at what has happened in Germany. Look at what is happening in these countries.Trump has completely failed to understand either that the refugees are not considered dangerous, or, again, that they are being held because of a categorical ban on ship-based refugee traffic.He also fails to understand the number of refugees in the agreement:Trump: I am the world\u2019s greatest person that does not want to let people into the country. And now I am agreeing to take 2,000 people and I agree I can vet them, but that puts me in a bad position. It makes me look so bad and I have only been here a week.Turnbull: With great respect, that is not right \u2013 It is not 2,000.Trump: Well, it is close. I have also heard like 5,000 as well.Turnbull: The given number in the agreement is 1,250 and it is entirely a matter of your vetting.Then Trump returns to his belief that they are bad, and failing to understand the concept that they have been detained merely because they arrived by sea and not because they committed a crime:Trump: I hate taking these people. I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people.Turnbull: I would not be so sure about that. They are basically \u2014Trump: Well, maybe you should let them out of prison.He still thinks they\u2019re criminals.Later, Trump asks what happens if all the refugees fail his vetting process:Trump: I hate having to do it, but I am still going to vet them very closely. Suppose I vet them closely and I do not take any?Turnbull: That is the point I have been trying to make.After several attempts by Turnbull to explain Australia\u2019s policy, Trump again expresses his total inability to understand what it is:Trump: Does anybody know who these people are? Who are they? Where do they come from? Are they going to become the Boston bomber in five years? Or two years? Who are these people?Turnbull: Let me explain. We know exactly who they are. They have been on Nauru or Manus for over three years and the only reason we cannot let them into Australia is because of our commitment to not allow people to come by boat. Otherwise we would have let them in. If they had arrived by airplane and with a tourist visa then they would be here.Trump: Malcom [sic], but they are arrived on a boat?After Turnbull has told Trump several times that the refugees have been detained because they arrived by boat, and only for that reason, Trump\u2019s question is, \u201cBut they are arrived on a boat?\u201dSoon after, Turnbull again reiterates that Australia\u2019s policy is to detain any refugee who arrives by boat:Turnbull: The only people that we do not take are people who come by boa. So we would rather take a not very attractive guy that help you out then to take a Noble [sic] Peace Prize winner that comes by boat. That is the point.\u201dTrump: What is the thing with boats? Why do you discriminate against boats? No, I know, they come from certain regions. I get it.No, you don\u2019t get it at all! It\u2019s not that they come from certain regions! It\u2019s that they come by boat!So Turnbull very patiently tries to explain again that the policy has nothing to do with what region the refugees come from:Turnbull: No, let me explain why. The problem with the boats it that you are basically outsourcing your immigration program to people smugglers and also you get thousands of people drowning at sea.At this point, Trump gives up asking about the policy and just starts venting about the terribleness of deals in general:I do not know what he got out of it. We never get anything out of it \u2014 START Treaty, the Iran deal. I do not know where they find these people to make these stupid deals. I am going to get killed on this thing.Shortly afterward, the call ends in brusque fashion, and Turnbull presumably begins drinking heavily.Tags:top storythe national interestpoliticsdonald trumpaustraliaAustralia\u2019s PM Slowly Realizes Trump Is a Complete IdiotShare on FacebookTweet this Story Top StoriesTrump\u2019s Fledgling Presidency Has Already CollapsedAustralia\u2019s Prime Minister Slowly Realizes Trump Is a Complete IdiotFelix Sater: Donald Trump\u2019s Original Russia ConnectionMost Viewed StoriesTrump\u2019s Fledgling Presidency Has Already CollapsedWhat\u2019s New on Netflix: August 2017Every Stephen King Movie, Ranked From Worst to BestAustralia\u2019s Prime Minister Slowly Realizes Trump Is a Complete IdiotAll 165 Pink Floyd Songs, Ranked From Worst to BestDisney\u2019s Live-Action Aladdin Casts Marwan Kenzari As (a Very Hot) Jafar, and Nasim Pedrad As Jasmine\u2019s FriendThe Best Movies of 2017 (So Far)The 10 Products I Use to Achieve the Elusive No-Makeup Makeup LookThe Best Horror Films of 2017 (So Far)I Love My Extremely Average Wife Popular Videos On Daily IntelligencerComments Latest News from Daily Intelligencer41 seconds agoHow Jeff Sessions Might Channel the Far-Right Crusade Against Affirmative ActionThe DOJ inserting itself into this debate would represent a dramatic break with history and prior practices.12:49 p.m.Trump and Kushner Push Back on Right-Wing Campaign to Fire McMaster, for NowEven the Russian Twitter bots have been piling on McMaster over the past week.10:39 a.m.Mueller Investigation Requests Flynn Documents From White HouseInvestigators now appear to be looking for evidence that Flynn committed a specific crime.Yesterday at 6:43 p.m.There May Not Be As Many \u2018Trump Democrats\u2019 As Previously ImaginedThe obsession with \u201cObama-Trump voters\u201d showing the fatal Democratic weakness in 2016 may be based on imaginary party-switchers voting GOP as usual.Yesterday at 6:34 p.m.Former Knick Charles Oakley Gets a One-Year Madison Square Garden BanHe agreed to the terms as part of a plea deal after he was arrested in February at a Knicks home game.Yesterday at 6:24 p.m.Trump White House Says U.S. Will Join Climate Talks, Despite Leaving Paris DealThe administration reiterated its commitment to exiting the Paris deal on Friday \u2014 unless the agreement\u2019s terms become \u201cmore favorable\u201d to the U.S.Yesterday at 5:30 p.m.Are Employers Using Trump\u2019s ICE Agents to Intimidate Workers?Instead of cracking down on employers who hire the undocumented, some ICE agents are allegedly helping them underpay their immigrant workers.Yesterday at 5:10 p.m.Forget \u2018Tax Reform.\u2019 Republicans Will Settle for Tax Cuts for the Rich.For all the talk of \u201ctax reform,\u201d Republicans would prefer to offset tax cuts with spending cuts, and in the end won\u2019t insist on offsets at all.Yesterday at 4:01 p.m.Martin Shkreli Found Guilty of FraudHe faces up to 20 years in prison.Yesterday at 1:41 p.m.House Moderates Have a Bipartisan Health-Care BillBut will the GOP leadership allow moderates to make Obamacare work better, when conservative donors want to see it fail?Yesterday at 1:38 p.m.Attorney General Jeff Sessions Says He\u2019s Cracking Down on Leakers, BiglyMore resources to sniff out the culprits, and a review of the subpoena policy.Yesterday at 1:23 p.m.Trump\u2019s Fledgling Presidency Has Already CollapsedAnd the one thing that could save him now is terrifying.Yesterday at 12:01 p.m.Someone Wants to Make a Movie About Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s White House GigTMZ reports a \u201cmajor Hollywood producer\u201d has approached the Mooch about a film or TV project.Yesterday at 11:25 a.m.Could Cynthia Nixon Primary Andrew Cuomo?Stranger things have happened.Yesterday at 10:58 a.m.July Jobs Report: 2017 Looking Exactly Like 2016It\u2019s becoming monotonous to report, but it\u2019s true: the slow but steady recovery continues, which could help Trump stabilize his shaky popularity.Yesterday at 10:44 a.m.Watch Kellyanne Conway and Chris Cuomo Get Into a Heated Debate on CNNConway accused the network of only focusing on the Russia story.Yesterday at 9:30 a.m.Bernie Sanders Is Your New Favorite YA AuthorHis YA book, The Bernie Sanders Guide to Political Revolution, comes out this month.Yesterday at 8:23 a.m.Title IX Enforcement Is Such a Mess Right NowThe most recent bizarre Title IX case involves a student whose university told her, despite her protestations otherwise, that she was a victim.Yesterday at 4:15 a.m.How Senators Are Trying to Block Trump From Firing MuellerThey unveiled two bipartisan bills that would require judicial review of any effort to oust the special counsel.Yesterday at 12:33 a.m.Secret Service Moves Out of Trump Tower Due to Lease Dispute: ReportThe Trump Organization drives a hard bargain \u2026 with the people who protect the president.
