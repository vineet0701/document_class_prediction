Flynn, President Trump\u2019s first national security adviser. Mr. Flynn resigned in February after it was disclosed that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about a telephone call with Russia\u2019s ambassador.Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster succeeded Mr. Flynn and has slowly tried to move out some of Mr. Flynn\u2019s appointees. He initially tried to fire Mr. Cohen-Watnick earlier this year, only to be rebuffed by Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist, and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser. But Mr. Kushner dropped his opposition this week, according to someone with knowledge of the decision.A fierce Trump loyalist, Mr. Cohen-Watnick drew attention when he and another White House official briefed Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, on classified intelligence reports revealing that American intelligence agencies had conducted incidental surveillance of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team. The briefing was intended to bolster Mr. Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that President Barack Obama ordered phones tapped at Trump Tower.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMr. Cohen-Watnick\u2019s resignation was announced by the White House late Wednesday. \u201cGeneral McMaster appreciates the good work accomplished in the N.S.C.\u2019s intelligence directorate under Ezra Cohen\u2019s leadership,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement. \u201cHe has determined that, at this time, a different set of experiences is best suited to carrying that work forward. General McMaster is confident that Ezra will make many further significant contributions to national security in another position in the administration.\u201d Continue reading the main storyAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyHis departure follows several others last month. Tera Dahl, the deputy chief of staff at the N.S.C. and a former writer for Breitbart News, which was run by Mr. Bannon before he joined the White House staff, left for a post at the United States Agency for International Development.Later in the month, in separate developments, Derek Harvey, the top Middle East adviser, and Rich Higgins, the director of strategic planning, were each pushed out.Newsletter Sign UpContinue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

General McMaster, whose relationship with the president has been strained at times, has long wanted to remove the pro-Flynn hard-liners from his staff. First to go was K. T. McFarland, a former Fox News analyst, who was pushed out as deputy national security adviser in May and nominated to be ambassador to Singapore.The latest moves come at a time of heightened unease in the world, punctuated by North Korea\u2019s recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, and continued uncertainty about the leadership and direction of the council, which was created to provide presidents with in-house guidance on foreign and military affairs.Mr. Trump, according to several administration officials, has been considering a shake-up that could include appointing Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, to take over as national security adviser, while sending General McMaster to command forces in Afghanistan. Such a move could earn General McMaster a fourth star.NBC News reported on Wednesday that the president recently suggested that Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the commander of American-led forces in Afghanistan, be fired. White House officials have said the president has yet to decide on any new moves.Mr. Trump has been considering a new strategy for Afghanistan, but it has become mired in his frustration over the options he has been given. General McMaster presented the president with a plan to bolster the effort in Afghanistan after a stormy meeting of national security officials, only to have Mr. Trump reject it. The president has publicly asked why the United States should still be in Afghanistan after nearly 16 years.A version of this article appears in print on August 3, 2017, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: White House Purging Flynn Allies From National Security Council.
