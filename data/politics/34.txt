Unions have faced similarly hard-fought battles to gain recognition at plants run by Boeing and Volkswagen \u2013 and lost.Sanders, the actor Danny Glover and leading labor officials have all campaigned in support of the UAW\u2019s attempts to unionise the 800-strong plant.Mississippi Nissan workers hope for historic win in 14-year fight to unionize Read moreNissan has union representation in 42 of 45 of its plants throughout the world, writes Sanders. \u201cBut the company does not want unions in the US south, because unions mean higher wages, safer working conditions, decent healthcare, and a secure retirement.\u201cCorporations like Nissan know that if they stop workers in Mississippi from forming a union, wages will continue to be abysmally low in this state.\u201dSanders says Nissan made $6.6bn in profits last year and paid its chief executive officer, Carlos Ghosn, more than $9.5m last year.\u201cThose kinds of obscene profits are a direct result of corporations\u2019 decades-long assault on workers and their unions,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe American middle class, once the envy of the world, is disappearing while income and wealth inequality is soaring.
