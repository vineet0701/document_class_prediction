In the universe of President Donald Trump, there is but a single deed more grievous than all the others.Player utilitiesPopoutSharedownloadListen to the Story. PRI.orgIt\u2019s leaking.Talking out of school \u2014 so to speak \u2014 is strictly verboten within the Trump inner circle. But it keeps happening.This time, it was a talk by Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and one of his top advisers at the White House. Kushner was speaking to a group of congressional interns on Monday. They were told not to record the Q&A with the president's son-in-law.But someone did. And the audio ended up at Wired.Kushner is someone who is rarely heard in public. He is also the man tasked by Trump to tackle \u2014 among many other monumental missions\u00a0\u2014 the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. That\u2019s why his comments on Monday about the long-running conflict in the Middle East have attracted some attention.The question put to Kushner was about how he plans to negotiate peace between the Israelis and Palestinians, and what the Trump administration brings to bear that is unique.Kushner spoke for about seven minutes total.All in all, his talk\u00a0was\u00a0\u201cnot very encouraging,\u201d says\u00a0Hussein Ibish, a senior scholar at\u00a0the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \u201cIt reads like a young man who really lacks any kind of detailed or nuanced background.\u201dAt one point, Kushner said that\u00a0\u201cnot a whole lot has been accomplished over the last 40 or 50 years.\u201dThis would appear to overlook the treaties signed by Israel, Egypt and Jordan. But Kushner has a point here, says Ibish. Because the peace process has never actually delivered on its core promise of a final peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.But Ibish adds that if the Trump administration really believes that US involvement in Middle East peace efforts is useless, then that's a problem. He says the Palestinians, in particular, saw some real signs for optimism at the start of Trump\u2019s term.\u201cTrump comes in and makes this an important agenda item. That means the Palestinian issue is suddenly back on the international and regional stage. [Palestinian Authority] President Abbas is in the White House and President Trump is visiting Ramallah and it puts the spotlight back on the Palestinians,\u201d Ibish says.There are signs, however, that patience is wearing thin.On Tuesday, a top Palestinian official accused the White House of abandoning the two-state solution. The last couple of weeks have seen yet another wave of protest and violence in Jerusalem's Old City.The Israelis might be entertaining fresh doubts about the Trump administration too, says Daniel Kurtzer, a Middle East policy studies professor\u00a0at Princeton University.\u00a0Kurtzer also has served as US ambassador to Israel and to Egypt.When the president's son-in-law\u00a0said there might be \u201cno solution\u201d\u00a0to this conflict, Kurtzer said that comes across as worrisome.\u201cTo be charitable, it could mean that [Kushner] hasn\u2019t come up with one yet, or he doesn\u2019t believe that the parties have one,\u201d Kurtzer says.\u201cBut it could also be the beginning of laying the groundwork of an exit strategy, where you report to the American people a few months from now or six months from now that, you know, \u2018We\u2019ve tried. We don\u2019t have a solution. And we\u2019re going to focus on other things.\u2019\u201dIf the latter is the case with the Trump administration, Kurtzer says that preparing for failure seems like a strange way to rally Israelis and Palestinians to commit to a US-sponsored peace process.On the question of what is unique about\u00a0the Trump team's approach to Middle East peace, Kushner seemed unsure.\"What do we offer that's unique? I don\u2019t know\u2026 I\u2019m sure everyone that\u2019s tried this has been unique in some ways,\" Kushner said.One more thing\u2026PRI takes a global approach to the news of the day.
