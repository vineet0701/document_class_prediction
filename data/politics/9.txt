The tweet Trump retweeted links to a foxnews.com story that\u2019s primarily an aggregation of a Wall Street Journal report about rising Obamacare premiums. But the story, published Tuesday, makes clear that the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to sabotage Obamacare are the primary culprit.The Trump administration continues to be noncommittal about whether the federal government will continue to pay the cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments for low-income people who purchase health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges. According to the Journal, uncertainty surrounding the CSR payments and whether the Trump administration will enforce Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate are the primary drivers of higher premiums on the exchanges. White House threatens to sabotage insurance of low-income people if Trumpcare isn\u2019t passedThe Trump administration is putting poor people in a lose-lose situation. \u201cIn Montana, Health Care Service linked 17 percentage points of its 23% rate increase request to concerns about the cost-sharing payments and enforcement of the mandate that requires everyone to purchase insurance,\u201d the Journal reports. \u201cKurt Kossen, a senior vice president at Health Care Service, said the company\u2019s rate requests are driven by causes including growing health costs and \u2018uncertainty and the associated risks that exist within this marketplace, including uncertainty around issues like the continued funding of [cost-sharing payments] and mechanisms that encourage broad and continuous coverage.'\u201dMichael Neidorff, chief executive of Centene Corp., told the Journal that within the exchanges, \u201cthere is relative stability.\u201d\u201cThe uncertainty is driven by these policies on the ACA,\u201d he added.Blue Cross of Idaho told the Journal that if the Trump administration just committed to making the CSR payments, premium increases would be in the low teens\u2014about half of the 28 percent increase they\u2019re requesting.The Fox News story Trump retweeted quotes White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney as saying,\u00a0\u201cA lot of us have lost focus on the fact that the system we have doesn\u2019t work.\u201d That comment echoes the sort of rhetoric Trump has used about Obamacare.Republican Senators are working very hard to get there, with no help from the Democrats. Not easy! Perhaps just let OCare crash & burn!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2017But Obamacare isn\u2019t crashing or burning. In March, the Congressional Budget Office concluded that Obamacare exchanges are likely to \u201cbe stable in most areas.\u201d\u201cThe subsidies to purchase coverage combined with the penalties paid by uninsured people stemming from the individual mandate are anticipated to cause sufficient demand for insurance by people with low health care expenditures for the market to be stable,\u201d the CBO wrote, debunking notions that Obamacare is in a \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d Trump tweet illustrates the danger of not reading, just watching Morning Joe insteadTrump gets most of his information from cable news, creating problems. This isn\u2019t the first time Trump has referred his Twitter followers to a story, seemingly unaware that the piece in question makes him look bad. In February,\u00a0Trump cited a Lawfare article in an attempt to build a case that the three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit made a bad decision when\u00a0they declined to reinstate his Muslim ban.LAWFARE: \"Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute.\" A disgraceful decision!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2017But had Trump read the article, he would\u2019ve seen that the author\u200a\u2014\u200aBenjamin Wittes, editor in chief of Lawfare and a Senior Fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution\u200a\u2014\u200aconcluded that the court actually made the right decision.\u201cThe Ninth Circuit is correct to leave the [restraining order] in place, in my view, for the simple reason that there is no cause to plunge the country into turmoil again while the courts address the merits of these matters over the next few weeks,\u201d Wittes writes, before concluding\u00a0his piece by blasting the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cincompetent malevolence.\u201dInstead of coming across the passage he tweeted out from reading the article, it appears Trump was alerted to the Lawfare piece by watching cable news.#Donald Trump, #Health Care, #PoliticsAboutCareersTipsEmailMasthead Think Progress Inline LogoFacebookTwitterYoutubeInstagram\u00a9 2017 ThinkProgress"}
