No, reallyCharles B. AnthonyThursday 9 February 2017 09:52 UTCLast update:\u00a0Friday 10 February 2017 12:35 UTC Topics: TrumpTags:\u00a0Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, America, religion, China, IslamShow commentsIf Steve Bannon was a Muslim then he wouldn\u2019t be let anywhere near the White House, never mind left with the keysSometimes a seemingly innocuous speech can potentially set the direction of the US presidency long before the Oval Office incumbent even declares they are running for office.Thus it is with the current White House administration \u2013 and Steve Bannon, Donald Trump\u2019s chief strategist.In July 2014, Bannon gave a\u00a049-minute speech and Q&A to a conference hosted by the Human Dignity Institute as part of its coverage of the rise of Europe\u2019s religious right.Beamed live from Los Angeles - via Skype - into a small conference room tucked away inside the Vatican, Bannon declared that \u201cthe Judeo-Christian West, is in a crisis\u2026 We\u2019re at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict.\u201dThe HDI proved a receptive audience. A lobby group for a \u201cChristian voice\u201d in European politics, its founder is former politician Benjamin Harnwell, who describes his stint as a European MP \u201cas being in a direct spiritual warfare against the devil\u201d and who believes that there is nothing really far-right about Marine Le Pen and the Alternative for Deutschland.\u201cWe\u2019ve come partly off-track in the years since the fall of the Soviet Union,\u201d continued Bannon. \u201cIn the 21st century, we are facing \u201ca crisis both of our church, a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, [and] a crisis of capitalism.\u201dBannon advocates \u201cenlightened capitalism of the Judeo-Christian West\u201d, based on the \u201cunderlying spiritual and moral foundations of Christianity\u201d.READ: Bannon in 14 Breitbart headlinesBut it\u2019s under attack, he told the HDI, from \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d \u2013 or what Bannon calls \u201cstate-controlled capitalism\u201d - and \u201clibertarian capitalism\u201d - two disturbing brands that fail to morally manage wealth creation and distribution in an ethical way.And who is to blame for this? Bannon identified the increasing secularisation of the West, a creeping secularism that has \u201csapped the strength of the Judeo-Christian West to defend its ideals.\u201dBut Trump\u2019s chief strategist also sees two other threats to the Judeo-Christian West on the horizon.\u00a0 And his response to each is shaped by religion.Bannon's problem with IslamThe first is Islam. Bannon believes that the West is \u201cat the beginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism\u201d and that the West should respond by taking \u201ca very, very, very aggressive stance against radical Islam\u201d.In July 2016, Bannon was interviewed by John Guandolo, a disgraced former FBI agent who is now an anti-Muslim activist and conspiracy theorist, on record as having said that American Muslims \u201cdo not have a First Amendment right to do anything.\u201d During that conversation, Bannon asked: \u201cHave we held back the dogs of war? Are we actually confronting and combating radical fundamental Islam in the United States of America and in places like our allies in France and the United Kingdom?\u201dBannon, let\u2019s not forget, is the author of a film script called The Islamic States of America, which argued that Islamists were taking over the US with help from mainstream media outlets, American Jews, FBI and the White House. He went on: \u201cDo you believe we have to prosecute this as a war, and we have to take care of this fifth column \u2013 there\u2019s clearly a fifth column here in the United States \u2013 that needs to be dealt with immediately?\u201dThen, in 2010, Bannon told Avi Davis \u2013 a senior fellow at the American Freedom Alliance, an organisation concerned with \u201cadvancing the values and ideals of Western Civilization\u201d - that \u201cIslam is not a religion of peace. Islam is a religion of submission.\u201dIt has the makings of an Islamophobic perfect storm, which will have disastrous consequences for the American Muslim communityIslam is a religion that Bannon believes needs to be suppressed. He told that audience in the Vatican: \u201cIf you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West's struggle against Islam, I believe that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think they kept it out of the world.\u201dBannon\u2019s words should be seen in the light of every executive order currently signed, or before, Trump. The Muslim ban. The proposed ban on the Muslim Brotherhood. The removal of white nationalists from the counter-extremism programme, to instead focus solely on Islam. And that\u2019s just in the first few weeks of office, all making for an Islamophobic perfect storm which will have disastrous consequences for the American Muslim community.Who else does Bannon have in his sights?But Bannon is not content with taking on the Muslim world. He also has his sights set on China.In a February 2016 interview that Bannon hosted with theologian Thomas D Williams (who runs Breitbart\u2019s operation in Rome), Bannon said: \u201cYou have an expansionist Islam and you have an expansionist China. Right? They are motivated. They\u2019re arrogant. They\u2019re on the march. And they think the Judeo-Christian West is on the retreat.\u201dBannon then adds that the one thing the Chinese fear more than America and capitalism is Christianity.China, he says, is \u201cone of the most vibrant Christian churches in the world\u2026 devout evangelicals, devout mainstream Protestants, and devout Catholics that are below the surface in China\u2026 it is a vibrant, vibrant, vibrant, Christian environment\u201d which is \u201cgoing to play into all this geopolitics.\u201dA month later Bannon would declared with certainty, in an interview with conservative movement historian Lee Edwards, that \u201cwe\u2019re [America] going to war in the South China Sea in five to 10 years\u2026 there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201dThe signs that Trump's on boardIf you chose to take on Islam and China, then you need a big army. At that 2014 HDI conference, Bannon called for a Christian militia, saying that they were at \u201cthe very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict.\u201dHe urged the church to become \u201cmilitant\u201d and \u201cfight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that\u2019s starting, that will completely eradicate everything that we\u2019ve been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years.\u201dFast forward to February 2017. With Trump in office, Bannon has now manoeuvred himself onto the National Security Council, influencing the administration\u2019s national security and foreign policy.Meanwhile Trump is speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, where he tells the audience that he will \u201ctotally destroy\u201d the Johnson Amendment, a 60-year-old tax code law that helps separate religion and politics in the United States.Trump\u2019s speech was a vision of religious nationalism, dominated by the two key themes of religion and militarism and intended to tee up a forthcoming \"religious freedom\"\u00a0executive order.READ: Muslims are the new Jews as fascism goes mainstreamTrump describes terrorism as a \u201cfundamental threat to religious freedom\u201d adding: \u201cFreedom is not a gift from government... Freedom is a gift from God.\u00a0 Faith in God has inspired men and women to sacrifice for the needy, to deploy to wars overseas and to lock arms at home.\u201dThis heady brew of nationalism and religion, combined with the intended destruction of the Johnson Amendment, carries all the hallmarks of Bannon: politicise and radicalise religion \u2013 then gain support for a global confrontation with its enemies.Bannon \u2013 and the Republican worldview - is also shaped by the legacy of Ronald Reagan, of whom he is a huge admirer, keeping a photo of the 40th president of the United States above his desk.In July 1980, Reagan was the first politician to say \u201cGod bless America\u201d during a nomination acceptance speech, winning over evangelical Christians. In 2004, politicised by the 9/11 attacks, Bannon wrote and directed In the Face of Evil, a documentary that lionised Reagan and his inner circle for taking on the \u201cevil empire\u201d of the Soviet Union.Bannon\u2019s vision for Trump is not too dissimilar to the description given of Reagan in the film\u2019s trailer: \u201cIn mankind\u2019s most bloodiest and barbaric century, came a man who with a vision, an outsider, a radical, with extreme views, of how to confront evil.\u201dWho going to help Bannon in this fight?Bannon told that audience at the Vatican: \u201cIf we do not bind together as partners with others in other countries then this conflict is only going to metastasize.\u201dWhere will these allies come from? Although critical of Russian state-capitalism, Bannon sees potential in a future alliance with Putin: \u201cWe, the Judeo-Christian West, really have to look at what he\u2019s [Putin] talking about as far as traditionalism goes - particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism - and I happen to think that the individual sovereignty of a country is a good thing and a strong thing.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Would Moscow team up with Washington in Bannon's war? MSNBC terrorism analyst Malcolm Nance seems to think so, arguing that Bannon is attempting to \u201calign the United States and Russia together in a Christian war against Islam.\u201d Putin might face a dilemma if Tehran, which is on the receiving end of war talk from the White House, is goaded into crossing a red line that is then used to justify military action.But Israel, which wants sanctions \u00a0against Iran, could make a good bedfellow. Although accusations of anti-Semitism have plagued Bannon, he has always been a staunch supporter of Israel due to its strong militarised religious nationalism and opposition to what he would refer to as radical Islam.READ: The rise and rise of Steve BannonOther allies could include France\u2019s Marine Le Pen, whose National Front party shares Bannon\u2019s hatred for \u201cfinancial globalisation and Islamist globalisation\". She is currently in the lead, according to polls, for the first round of presidential voting in April.Then there is Geert Wilders, an Islamophobic Dutch MP and regular Breitbart contributor, whose Freedom Party (PVV) party looks set to take the majority of seats in the Dutch Parliament later this year.Bannon believes conflict began in 2008Bannon\u2019s obsession with conflict is reflected too in his obsession with a chilling social theory.TIME Magazine reported that during the early 2000s, Bannon became fascinated with The Fourth Turning, a book by generational theorists William Strauss and Neil Howe. The authors predict that American institutions are reborn every 80 years: from the American Revolution (1775 - 1783) to the American Civil War (1861 \u2013 1865) to the Second World War (1939 \u2013 1945).Each of these events consists of a four-part cycle, repeated over and over by successive generations:Fall into crisisEmbrace institutionsRebel against institutionsForget the lessons and start the next crisis, which in turn destroys and rebuilds institutionsIn 2010, Bannon was inspired to produce the documentary Generation Zero, in which he depicted the 2008 financial crisis as a warning that the next Turning was near. According to TIME, Bannon \u201cseemed to relish the opportunity to clean out the old order and build a new one in its place.\u201dIndeed, in a speech to the Liberty Restoration Foundation in 2011, Bannon said: \u201cWe had the revolution. We had the civil war. We had the Great Depression and World War Two. This is the great Fourth Turning in American history, and we\u2019re going to be one thing on the other side.\u201dSo when Robert Reich, who served in the Clinton administration, says that if left \u201cunsupervised by people who know what they're doing Trump and Bannon could... bring the world closer to a nuclear holocaust\u201d - he isn\u2019t being hysterical.If Bannon was a Muslim then he wouldn\u2019t be let anywhere near the White House, never mind left with the keys. Instead the world would unite in calling him an extremist and hate preacher. There would be a global urgency to stopping him from further radicalising people for his ultimate goal of global jihad.The focus is on the Trump circus, as Twitter theatrics take the sting out of what really is a dark, twisted nihilistic force pulling the levers of power in the Oval OfficeBut instead the focus is on the Trump circus, as Twitter theatrics take the sting out of what really is a dark, twisted nihilistic force pulling the levers of power in the Oval Office.\u201cThe greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist,\u201d said Roger \"Verbal\" Kint, aka Keyser Soze, at the end of The Usual Suspects.In the coming months, the checks and balances of American democracy are going to be tested like never before \u2013 and will need to react quickly in the current climate.As Bannon told the New York Times about the first few weeks of the Trump administration: \u201cWe are moving big and we are moving fast\u2026 we didn\u2019t come here to do small things.\u201dBannon is driving America, and potentially the rest of the world, off a cliff. It\u2019s going to be terrifying to watch.\u00a0-\u00a0Charles B.
