Jeff FlakeJeff FlakeTrump admin not opposed to new war authorization McCain: Arizona was about to get 'screwed' by GOP healthcare plan Trump, GOP senators unveil measure to cut legal immigration MORE (R-Ariz.) has a job approval rating of only 18 percent in Arizona, according to a new poll.A survey from the left-leaning Public Policy Polling\u00a0finds\u00a062 percent of Arizona voters disapprove\u00a0of the job the senator\u00a0is doing. Another 19 percent are not sure.If the 2018 midterm election\u00a0were held today, just 31 percent of respondents said they would support Flake's bid, compared to 47 percent who said they would support a generic Democratic opponent, according to the poll.Another 22 percent of respondents said they were not sure who they would support.ADVERTISEMENTThe poll was conducted from July 31 to Aug. 1 among 704 Arizona voters.Flake \u2014 who in recent days has been making the rounds to promote\u00a0his latest\u00a0book \u2014 has been increasingly\u00a0critical of\u00a0President Trump in public.The Arizona Republican recently said in a piece for Politico that\u00a0his party is in denial about the damage Trump\u00a0is doing\u00a0and called on his GOP\u00a0colleagues to stand up to\u00a0the president when they see his rhetoric has gone astray.\u201cTo carry on in the spring of 2017 as if what was happening was anything approaching normalcy required a determined suspension of critical faculties. And tremendous powers of denial,\u201d Flake wrote in the op-ed.\u00a0On Tuesday, Flake defended his actions, saying there are some things that \"are more important than a political career.\"A Democratic National Committee spokesman said it wasn't a surprise the Arizona senator had such high disapproval ratings, pointing to his healthcare votes\u201cAfter Senator Jeff Flake was complicit in Republican efforts to take health care away from millions of working families it\u2019s no surprise that the majority of Arizonans disapprove of their Senator\u2019s job performance,\" spokesman Vedant Patel said in a statement.\"Surprisingly, Senator Flake and Republicans have still not shied away from an agenda that prioritizes the wealthy and steam rolls the middle class.\"\u2014Updated at 2:27 p.m. Tags Jeff Flake &nbsp View the discussion thread.Most PopularMost PopularDiscussed Past:1 day 1McMaster: Trump has made 'a number...
