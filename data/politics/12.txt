The call transcript, however, reveals Trump said\u00a0he must mislead the American people in order to sail through the turmoil he had created with the Mexican president.\u201c[Y]ou and I are both at a point now where we are both saying we are not to pay for the wall,\u201d Trump said. \u201cFrom a political standpoint, that is what we will say. We cannot say that anymore because if you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that. I am willing to say that we will work it out, but that means it will come out in the wash and that is okay. But you cannot say anymore that the United States is going to pay for the wall.\u201d\u201cI am just going to say that we are working it out,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cBelieve it or not, this is the least important thing that we are talking about, but politically this might be the most important talk about.\u201dLater, Pe\u00f1a Nieto returned to the wall, and made\u00a0his position clear: \u201cI have recognized the right of any government to protect its borders as it deems necessary and convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my position has been and will continue to be very firm saying that Mexico cannot pay for that wall.\u201d\u201cBut you cannot say that to the press,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cThe press is going to go with that and I cannot live with that.\u00a0You cannot say that to the press because I cannot negotiate under those circumstances.\u201dPe\u00f1a Nieto responded: \u201cI understand you well, Mr. President.\u201dThe House of Representatives recently appropriated nearly $1.6 billion\u00a0in federal funds to begin wall construction next year, though the bill has to clear the Senate.President Trump has abandoned his near-constant campaign promise that Mexico would pay for the border wall.
