Australia\u2019s Malcolm Turnbull is blunt and insistent. But the two approaches both result in them getting their way with the president.Donald Trump with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a NietoYuri Cortez / AFP / GettyMost Popular Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?

It\u2019s highly unusual for the public to know. Both parties usually release a \u201creadout\u201d that crisply summarizes the call and smooths over the roughest spots. Sometimes, there are revealing differences in the readouts, but often they\u2019re close\u2014neither side wants to publicize private conversations. (And when there\u2019s no agreed-upon readout, as after President Trump\u2019s July summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, it sometimes causes rancor.) On rarer occasions, details will leak\u2014in February, The Washington Post reported that Trump\u2019s call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had turned acrimonious.Related StoryForeign Leaders Have Realized Trump Is a Pushover What never happens is that a full transcript of a conversation leaks.Until now. (This truly is the never-say-never administration.) The Post on Thursday published full White House transcripts of two January calls\u2014the Turnbull conversation, and another with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. As one might expect, they are full of interesting nuggets.In those early days, before chaos totally engulfed his White House, Trump shows himself to be attentive to campaign promises about Mexico paying for a border wall and about not accepting any refugees. The president comes off as underprepared at times; he asks Turnbull to tutor him on details of a U.S agreement with Australia. He is full of bluster and nonsense (\u201cI won with a large percentage of Hispanic voters,\u201d he tells EPN, untruthfully) and outrageous comments (\u201cUp in New Hampshire\u2014I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den\u2014is coming from the southern border,\u201d Trump says, although he lost the state to Hillary Clinton in the general election.)He is also unusually clear and complex in his discussions. Some publications, most notably STAT, have picked up on a marked decline in the president\u2019s vocabulary and syntax over past statements. But while Trump is brash and unprepared in these calls, he is comparatively articulate\u2014raising the possibility that he is intentionally dumbing down his speech in public, not only in rallies and speeches but also in press interviews, where he is sometimes entirely incoherent.It\u2019s probably not a good thing, in general, for transcripts like this to leak. Some elements of statecraft are necessarily private, and if they leak regularly, foreign leaders may be wary of speaking to Trump; or they might leak their own transcripts to try to inoculate themselves. That sources saw fit to leak these, against all precedent, shows how little control Trump has over the executive branch, and how many people there seem to dislike or distrust him.But we do have these transcripts, and so examining them offers an extremely rare window into statecraft, and in particular into the different ways that two foreign leaders tried to grapple with Trump, an unproven leader with a reputation as a bit of a loose cannon. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, whose differences with Trump on policy are enormous, attempts a far more suave, conciliatory approach, downplaying differences and seeking to soothe Trump. Turnbull, on the other hand, as the leader of a traditionally close ally, adopts a far more aggressive, in-your-face style.Which approach works better? The Turnbull call ends in some bitterness, but it\u2019s notable that Trump basically concedes to Turnbull, admitting the U.S. would follow through on an agreed-upon intake of refugees. (Despite declaring it a \u201cdumb deal\u201d on Twitter following the call, Trump never backed out of it.) Yet Pe\u00f1a Nieto seems to have notched a win, too. Trump implores him not to say publicly that Mexico will not pay for a border wall, but he acknowledges the reality, and public claims that Mexico will pay for the wall have largely faded from Trump\u2019s public statements.The Conciliator: Enrique Pe\u00f1a NietoMexico\u2019s president, known as EPN, is a smooth, polished politician, a skill that helped land him the presidency, but has not protected him from disastrously low approval ratings\u2014in part thanks to complaints that he\u2019s been too supine toward Trump. EPN has a tough task: He knows that Trump\u2019s central promise was to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it, and he knows both that the wall would be bad for Mexico and that there\u2019s no way Mexico will pay for it. But he also knows that the U.S. is a crucial ally and neighbor. So EPN takes a softer approach.One thing that sticks out from this call is that the Mexican leader calls Trump \u201cMr. President\u201d with surprising frequency\u2014nearly 30 times over the course of the call. Trump greets him as \u201cMr. President,\u201d but throughout the rest of the call calls him \u201cEnrique.\u201d Perhaps that\u2019s an intentional move by Trump to make clear the power dynamic; it\u2019s classic negging. Or maybe Trump just isn\u2019t thinking about it. In any case, Pe\u00f1a Nieto bears the slight without complaint.Throughout the call, EPN firmly insists that Mexico will not pay for the wall, but he also pours on the flattery for Trump, speaking about how he understands his position and looking for ways to build the relationship while acknowledging the difference of opinion on the wall.\u201cThe first thing I want to say is that I highly appreciate the openness of your team and the willingness of your team to work to open a new framework between our two countries,\u201d he says. He also subtly reminds Trump of what he is doing already: \u201cI want to also thank you personally for what you said last Wednesday on the importance of Mexico to have a strong economy, and also the responsibility our administration has accepted to stop illegal trafficking of weapons and money coming into Mexico.\u201dEPN tries to show Trump how their situations are similar:I understand, Mr. President, the small political margin that you have now in terms of everything you said that you established throughout your campaign. But I would also like to make you understand, President Trump, the lack of margin I have as President of Mexico to accept this situation. And this has been, unfortunately, the critical point that has not allowed us to move forward in the building of the relationship between our two countries. I propose, Mr. President, for you to allow us to look for ways to save these differences.But Pe\u00f1a Nieto tries to plead his case. He objects to Trump\u2019s recent mention of a border tax. Trump\u2019s answer suggests that he has not mastered, or does not recognize, the difference between public and private speech.\u201cEnrique, if I can interrupt\u2014this is not a new proposal,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is what I have been saying for a year and a half on the campaign trail. I have been telling this to every group of 50,000 people or 25,000 people\u2014because no one got people in their rallies as big as I did.\u201dSetting aside the gratuitous boast at the end, there\u2019s something commendable about Trump\u2019s interjection. EPN seems to assume that campaign language is campaign language, but what the two governments have actually discussed in private is a different world. For Trump, in this case, there is no difference.On the other hand, Trump is soon doing the same thing\u2014acknowledging that while he doesn\u2019t think Mexico will pay for the wall, he doesn\u2019t want Pe\u00f1a Nieto to say that publicly, because it will hurt Trump politically.\u201cWe cannot say that anymore because if you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you cannot say that to the press. The press is going to go with that and I cannot live with that.\u201dEPN again tries to smooth things over, acknowledging Trump\u2019s situation and diplomatically seeking a different path.\u201cI understand you well, Mr. President,\u201d he says. \u201cI understand this critical point and I understand the critical political position that this constitutes for your country and for you, Mr. President. Let us look for a creative way to jump over this obstacle. It does not mean that this is not an important issue\u2014this is an important issue.\u201dSo far, EPN\u2019s approach seems to have worked. The phone call ends pleasantly, despite the remaining gulf between the men, and Trump seldom talks about Mexico paying for the wall anymore.The Bulldog: Malcolm TurnbullAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is a man with more in common with Trump, at least on paper, than Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Not only is Australia a close American ally with few obvious policy differences, but even in experience and temperament: \u201cI believe you and I have similar backgrounds, unusual for politicians, more businessman but I look forward to working together,\u201d says Turnbull. And yet this call turned out to be far more acrimonious than the one with Pe\u00f1a Nieto. (Interestingly, when word of the sharp words leaked, Trump insisted it was false: \u201cThank you to Prime Minister of Australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about. Very nice!\u201d It turns out he was not telling the truth.) Turnbull\u2019s theory seems to be that Trump understands force and will respond to it, and he too seems to have been proven right.The central point of tension was a group of 1,250 refugees from several countries who had arrived in Australia by boat. Australia refused to take them in, but convinced the Obama administration to do so. Trump, who had promised to end refugee resettlement, was less than enthused. (My colleague Krishnadev Calamur explains the controversy in more detail here.)Turnbull makes little effort to put Trump at ease\u2014he only drops three \u201cMr. Presidents\u201d\u2014and he heads straight into the controversy.\u201cMr. President, can I return to the issue of the resettlement agreement that we had with the Obama administration with respect to some people on Nauru and Manus Island?\u201d Turnbull asks. He notes that he had previously spoken with Vice President Mike Pence, and suggests that Pence himself disagreed with the president: \u201cI do understand you are inclined to a different point of view than the vice president.\u201d (It was Pence who, in April, announced that the U.S. would honor the deal.)Trump soon gets distracted, delivering a digression about the evils of refugees. Turnbull steers him back: \u201cCan you hear me out, Mr. President?\u201d Trump replies, \u201cYeah, go ahead.\u201d He repeatedly pushes Trump back on topic and explains the policy, which the president clearly has not fully absorbed. (At one point he questions the number of people involved.)\u201cYes, but let me describe what it is. I think it is quite consistent. I think you can comply with it,\u201d Turnbull says at one point. At another: \u201cLet me explain. We know exactly who they are.\u201d When Trump goes on a tangent about the Boston bombers, Turnbull will have none of it: \u201cThey were Russians. They were not from any of these countries.\u201dSoon Trump realizes that Turnbull is himself an immigration hardliner. Australia refused to take the people for fear it would encourage human smuggling. \u201cEven if we think you are the best person in the world, even if you are a Nobel Prize-winning genius, we will not let you in,\u201d Turnbull says.Trump is impressed: \u201cThat is a good idea. We should do that too. You are worse than I am.\u201dWhen Trump claims that he\u2019ll be \u201ckilled\u201d politically, Turnbull just dismisses it: \u201cYou will not.\u201d And then he goes for the kill himself: He simply states flatly that Trump will stick to terms of the deal, whether he likes it or not. \u201cYou can certainly say that it was not a deal that you would have done, but you are going to stick with it,\u201d Turnbull declares.Trump is angry:I have no choice to say that about it. Malcolm, I am going to say that I have no choice but to honor my predecessor\u2019s deal. I think it is a horrible deal, a disgusting deal that I would have never made. It is an embarrassment to the United States of America and you can say it just the way I said it. I will say it just that way. As far as I am concerned that is enough Malcom. I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous\u2026. This is crazy.But Turnbull doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s gotten what he wanted. \u201cThank you for your commitment. It is very important to us,\u201d he says.* * *Two countries, two leaders, two approaches\u2014yet both succeeded, for different reasons. The calls with Malcolm Turnbull and Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto are not only a valuable document of how diplomacy works; they would also set a pattern. Time and again, foreign leaders have found that Trump is hardly the hardened negotiator he claims, but is instead a pushover. If they can get into a one-on-one conversation with Trump, they can usually convince him to come around to their position. If that was true on paying for the wall and taking refugees, it stands to reason it would be true for lesser Trump priorities, too.ShareTweetCommentsLatest VideoWhat Does 'Late Capitalism' Really Mean?

TwengeMore comfortable online than out partying, post-Millennials are safer, physically, than adolescents have ever been. But they\u2019re on the brink of a mental-health crisis.One day last summer, around noon, I called Athena, a 13-year-old who lives in Houston, Texas. She answered her phone\u2014she\u2019s had an iPhone since she was 11\u2014sounding as if she\u2019d just woken up. We chatted about her favorite songs and TV shows, and I asked her what she likes to do with her friends. \u201cWe go to the mall,\u201d she said. \u201cDo your parents drop you off?,\u201d I asked, recalling my own middle-school days, in the 1980s, when I\u2019d enjoy a few parent-free hours shopping with my friends. \u201cNo\u2014I go with my family,\u201d she replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll go with my mom and brothers and walk a little behind them. I just have to tell my mom where we\u2019re going. I have to check in every hour or every 30 minutes.\u201dThose mall trips are infrequent\u2014about once a month. More often, Athena and her friends spend time together on their phones, unchaperoned. Unlike the teens of my generation, who might have spent an evening tying up the family landline with gossip, they talk on Snapchat, the smartphone app that allows users to send pictures and videos that quickly disappear. They make sure to keep up their Snapstreaks, which show how many days in a row they have Snapchatted with each other. Sometimes they save screenshots of particularly ridiculous pictures of friends. \u201cIt\u2019s good blackmail,\u201d Athena said. (Because she\u2019s a minor, I\u2019m not using her real name.) She told me she\u2019d spent most of the summer hanging out alone in her room with her phone. That\u2019s just the way her generation is, she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a choice to know any life without iPads or iPhones.

It will ask the question, according to co-creator David Benioff, \u00a0\u201cWhat would the world have looked like \u2026 if the South had won?\u201d A swirl of virtual protests and op-eds have greeted this proposed premise. In response, HBO has expressed \u201cgreat respect\u201d for its critics but also said it hopes that they will \u201creserve judgment until there is something to see.\u201dThis request sounds sensible at first pass. Should one not \u201creserve judgment\u201d of a thing until after it has been seen? But HBO does not actually want the public to reserve judgment so much as it wants the public to make a positive judgment. A major entertainment company does not announce a big new show in hopes of garnering dispassionate nods of acknowledgement. HBO executives themselves judged Confederate before they\u2019d seen it\u2014they had to, as no television script actually exists. HBO hoped to communicate that approval to its audience through the announcement. And had that communication been successful, had Confederate been greeted with rapturous anticipation, it is hard to imagine the network asking its audience to tamp down and wait.

McMasterRosie GrayRumors have circulated for days that the national-security adviser\u2019s job is on the line, and the pro-Trump media have launched an all-out assault against him.Updated on August 5 at 11:51 a.m. ETLong-simmering tensions within the White House burst into public view this week after the firings of three National Security Council officials, resulting in National-Security Adviser H.R. McMaster becoming Public Enemy No. 1 of the pro-Trump online brigades.McMaster has cleaned house at the NSC over the past few weeks. Via his deputy Ricky Waddell, he fired director of strategic planning Rich Higgins last month over a memo Higgins wrote alleging a deep-state conspiracy against President Trump. McMaster then dismissed two top officials brought on by the previous national-security adviser, Michael Flynn: the NSC\u2019s senior director for the Middle East, Derek Harvey, who was fired last week; and the senior director for intelligence programs, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, who was let go on Wednesday. Continue Reading Molly Riley / ReutersThe Myth of Reverse RacismVann R. Newkirk IIThe idea of white victimhood is increasingly central to the debate over affirmative action.Contrary to initial indications, the civil-rights division of the Department of Justice won\u2019t be dismantling affirmative action after all. At least, that\u2019s the current word from Trump administration officials, after a New York Times article claimed the department would be using the broad powers of justice to take on universities that it decided had discriminated against white people. The DOJ since clarified that it was gearing up to investigate complaints from dozens of organizations alleging that certain universities used quotas\u2014which are illegal\u2014to limit the number of Asian American enrollees.Still, the beacons have been lit, and America\u2019s annual heated argument about affirmative action has begun anew, this time against the background of racial tensions that have helped define the early goings of the Trump presidency. As always, those tensions and long-held beliefs about racial advantages rule the debate. Continue Reading Andr\u00e9 CarrilhoThe Whitest Music EverJames ParkerProg rock was audacious, innovative\u2014and awful.\u201cWe are the most uncool people in Miami.\u201d So begins, promisingly enough, David Weigel\u2019s The Show That Never Ends: The Rise and Fall of Prog Rock. Weigel, along with 3,000 fellow Yes-heads, Rush-oids, Tull freaks, and votaries of King Crimson\u2014cultural underdogs all, twitching and grimacing with revenge-of-the-nerds excitement\u2014is at the port of Miami, about to embark on a five-day progressive-rock-themed cruise: a floating orgy of some of the most despised music ever produced by long-haired white men.Do you like prog rock, the extravagantly conceptual and wildly technical post-psychedelic subgenre that ruled the world for about 30 seconds in the early 1970s before being torn to pieces by the starving street dogs of punk rock? Do you like the proggers, with their terrible pampered proficiency, their priestly robes, and their air\u2014once they get behind their instruments\u2014of an inverted, almost abscessed Englishness? I don\u2019t. At least, I think I don\u2019t. I like Queen\u2019s \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d which is a kind of wonderful satirical compression of prog rock, a fast-forward operetta with goofy existentialist trappings and a heavy-metal blowout in the middle; I like the bit of Mike Oldfield\u2019s Tubular Bells that became the theme music for The Exorcist. And there are contemporary bands I adore that have been grazed by prog: the moody, alchemical Tool, the obtuse and crushing Meshuggah. But for naked prog, the thing itself, I seem to lack the mettle. The trapped, eunuch ferocity of Geddy Lee\u2019s voice, squealing inside the nonsense clockwork of Rush, disturbs me. And Yes\u2019s Tales From Topographic Oceans is an experience to me unintelligible and close to unbearable, like being read aloud a lengthy passage of prose with no verbs in it.

Named in 2011, the American Psychological Association recently described it as the dread and helplessness that come with \u201cwatching the slow and seemingly irrevocable impacts of climate change unfold, and worrying about the future for oneself, children, and later generations.\u201dIt\u2019s not a formal diagnosis. Anxiety is traditionally defined by an outsized stress response to a given stimulus. In this case, the stimulus is real, as are the deleterious effects of stress on the body.This sort of disposition toward ecological-based distress does not pair well with a president who has denied the reality of the basis for this anxiety. Donald Trump has called climate change a fabrication on the part of \u201cthe Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\u201d He has also led the United States to become the only G20 country that will not honor the Paris Climate Accord, and who has appointed fossil-fuel advocates to lead the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency.

But I have my doubts. The president\u2019s disruption engine is powered by three paradoxes. Each was made possible by technological innovations. All will endure long after this ringmaster moves his circus to another town. Continue Reading Jonathan Ernst / ReutersTrump Has Quietly Accomplished More Than It AppearsDavid A.

Trump\u2019s top legislative priority, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, seems dead for the moment. (Tax reform? Forget it.)

As he walked through halls full of ancient bones, he had no idea that a week later, he\u2019d add to their ranks by finding one of the most spectacular dinosaur fossils of all time. It\u2019s an animal so well preserved that its skeleton can\u2019t be seen for the skin and soft tissues that still cover it.When we look at dinosaurs in museums, it takes imagination to plaster flesh and skin on top of the bones. But for the dinosaur that Funk unearthed\u2014a 110-million-year-old creature named Borealopelta\u2014imagination isn\u2019t necessary. It looks like a sculpture. And based on pigments that still lurk within the skin, scientists think they know what colors the animal had. \u201cIf someone wants to come face to face with a dinosaur, and see what it actually looked like, this is the one for that,\u201d says Caleb Brown from the Royal Tyrrell Museum, who has studied the animal.
