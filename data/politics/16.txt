Comey has since testified before Congress that Trump asked him to end an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael T Flynn and kept memos about his meetings with the president. Quick Guide Five key departures in six months of Trump's presidency Show Hide Anthony Scaramucci (10 days)Named director of communications after having been denied a White House role earlier, the New York financier and Republican fundraiser promptly\u00a0threatened to fire everyone in his team\u00a0over leaks. He also staged a combative and\u00a0contradictory\u00a0briefing room debut and talkshow tour; sought to bat away questions about\u00a0suspiciously liberal pronouncements\u00a0in his past and support for Trump\u2019s Republican enemies;\u00a0deleted tweets; warred openly with the former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and seemingly forced him out; compared the struggle to take healthcare away from millions of Americans to\u00a0Lincoln\u2019s battle against slavery; poured obscene invective about leakers, Priebus and Steve Bannon\u00a0down the phone to a New Yorker reporter; missed the birth of his son;\u00a0saw his wife file for divorce; and was asked to resign.Michael Flynn (23 days)Trump\u2019s first national security adviser \u2013 one of four generals the president has employed \u2013\u00a0resigned\u00a0after it was revealed he misled Vice-President Mike Pence over his contacts with Russians during the election campaign. It was later reported that Yates had\u00a0warned\u00a0the White House Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail.James Comey (110 days)The most shocking firing of them all.\u00a0Trump sacked his FBI director, by messenger rather than in person, as congressional and justice department investigations into links between Trump aides and Russia gathered pace. Lest anyone retain any doubt about why Trump pressed the big red button, he told NBC in a primetime interview the firing was tied to \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d. The reverberations will be felt for some time yet.Sean Spicer (183 days)The long-suffering but loyal surrogate for the president\u00a0handed in his resignationin response to Scaramucci\u2019s appointment. A Republican insider and Priebus ally, he never settled into the press secretary role after\u00a0an infamous debut\u00a0in which he angrily insisted Trump\u2019s fantastic version of crowd sizes at the inauguration were true. Achieving by way of Melissa McCarthy\u2019s\u00a0lethal Saturday Night Live impression\u00a0a somewhat dubious celebrity, his days at the White House were long rumoured to be numbered. His departure on a point of principle having seemingly been justified only 10 days later, he may now claim a sort of hollow vindication.Reince Priebus (189 days)The former Republican National Committee chair stayed loyal \u2013 at least in public \u2013 to Trump through Friday,\u00a0when he was told his time was up. He stayed loyal after handing in his resignation too, rhapsodising about the president and his mission in interviews with CNN and, of course, Fox News. But it seemed Priebus\u2019s card had alway been marked, less over his initial blocking of Scaramucci, which enraged the Mooch, or by his closeness to the House speaker, Paul Ryan, than by his private advice to Trump to quit the presidential race after 8 October, when the infamous Access Hollywood \u201cGropegate\u201d tape was published. The Washington Post reported that Priebus was thus never considered a member of the \u201cOct 8th coalition\u201d, a name for the inner cabal of Trumpites who have never wavered, however low their boss\u2019s reputation has sunk.Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.The book was acquired by Flatiron, an Macmillan imprint, which promises that Comey will cite \u201cexamples from some of the highest-stakes situations in the past two decades of US government\u201d. It will also \u201cshare yet unheard anecdotes from his long and distinguished career\u201d.The book is currently untitled and scheduled for publication next spring.\u201cThroughout his career, James Comey has had to face one difficult decision after another, as he has served the leaders of our country,\u201d Flatiron said in a statement. \u201cHis book promises to take us inside those extraordinary moments in our history, showing us how these leaders have behaved under pressure. By doing so, Director Comey will give us unprecedented entry into the corridors of power, and a remarkable lesson in leadership itself.\u201dSeveral publishers bid for the book and three officials with knowledge of the negotiations said the auction topped $2m. The officials asked not to be identified because they were not authorised to discuss the book.Over the past two decades, Comey has been praised and criticised by both Democrats and Republicans. In 2004, he was among the justice department officials who threatened to quit after officials in the George W Bush administration pressured then attorney general John Ashcroft to authorise a domestic surveillance programme begun in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. (The programme was eventually restructured.)During the 2016 presidential campaign, Comey was twice at the centre of news involving the FBI\u2019s investigation into whether Clinton, the Democratic candidate, broke any laws by using a private email server while secretary of state.In June 2016, Comey announced that while the bureau had concluded there was no reason to bring criminal charges, Clinton and her associates had been \u201cextremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information\u201d. In late October, less than two weeks before the election, he wrote to Congress saying that the FBI had found emails that \u201cappear to be pertinent\u201d to the investigation.Although he announced two days before the election that no charges would be recommended, the focus on Clinton\u2019s emails is widely believed to have contributed to her narrow defeat.TopicsAutobiography and memoirJames ComeyPublishingBiographyDonald TrumpnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content most viewed The Guardianback to tophomeUKworldsportfootballopinioncultureselectedbusinesslifestylefashionenvironmenttechtravelall sectionsclosehomeUKeducationmediasocietylawscotlandwalesnorthern irelandworldeuropeUSamericasasiaaustraliaafricamiddle eastcitiesdevelopmentsportfootballcricketrugby unionF1tennisgolfcyclingboxingracingrugby leaguefootballlive scorestablescompetitionsresultsfixturesclubsopinioncolumnistsletterseditorialscultureselectedfilmtv & radiomusicgamesbooksselectedart & designstageclassicalbusinesseconomicsbankingretailmarketseurozonelifestylefoodrecipeshealth & fitnesslove & sexfamilywomenhome & gardenfashionenvironmentclimate changewildlifeenergypollutiontechtravelUKeuropeUSmoneypropertysavingspensionsborrowingcareersscienceprofessional networksthe observertoday's paperobituariesg2weekendthe guidesaturday reviewsunday's papercommentthe new reviewobserver magazinemembershipcrosswordsblogeditorquickcrypticprizequipticgeniusspeedyeverymanazedweekendvideopodcastsdigital archiveCulture\u203aBooks\u203aAutobiography and memoirbooksmusictv & radioart & designfilmgamesclassicalstageback to topbecome a supportermake a contributionsecuredropsolve technical issueadvertise with uswork for uscontact uscomplaints & correctionsterms & conditionsprivacy policycookie policydigital newspaper archiveall topicsall contributorsFacebookTwitter\u00a9 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
