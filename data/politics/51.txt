However, his story is newly relevant in light of a lawsuit filed this week that accused President Trump and the White House of playing a role in a \u201cfake news\u201d story designed to advance the same conspiracy theory.Feinberg started at Sputnik in January, just as Trump took office. He was the outlet\u2019s first reporter to work inside the West Wing. In a conversation with Yahoo News on Wednesday, Feinberg alleged that Sputnik wanted him to bring up a news article that\u2019s at the center of the lawsuit in the White House press briefing room.The story, which was published on the Fox News website on May 16 and retracted a\u00a0week later, suggested Rich may have played a role in last year\u2019s leak of DNC emails. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that the email leak was orchestrated by the Russian government to help Trump defeat his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. There are multiple investigations into whether Trump and his campaign colluded with Russia.Feinberg said that during a meeting held on May 26, his superiors asked him bring up the story in the press briefing.\u201cIt was, \u2018We want you to ask about Seth Rich and just, you know, ask about the case and if those revelations should put an end to the Russia hacking narrative and the investigation,\u201d said Feinberg.According to Feinberg, his bosses handed him a termination letter when he declined. He described the situation as \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really telling that the White House is pushing the same narrative as a state-run Russian propaganda outlet,\u201d Feinberg said.Feinberg previously discussed his departure from Sputnik with Yahoo News in May, on the day he left his job. He said he didn\u2019t initially have reservations about working for a government-owned site but came to feel they wanted him to falsely \u201cspin\u201d the news.\u201cI thought as long as I just do what everyone else does \u2026 as long as I do the job fairly and accurately, I thought it would be OK,\u201d Feinberg said at the time. \u201cThere are lots of state-owned news outlets; Sputnik\u2019s not the only one.\u201dThe lawsuit was filed by a Washington private investigator named Rod Wheeler in a New York federal court on Tuesday. Wheeler\u2019s suit alleges\u00a0that a Dallas financier and Republican donor named Ed Butowsky worked with Fox News reporter Malia Zimmerman to create a false news\u00a0story linking Rich\u2019s death to the DNC email leak.Rich was shot in Washington, D.C., last July, shortly after the emails were published by WikiLeaks. Police have said they believe he was killed in a botched robbery, though the murder remains unsolved. There has been no evidence linking Rich to the theft of the emails or their publication.View photosMary Rich, the mother of slain DNC staffer Seth Rich, gives a press conference in August 2016.

Before the story was published, Wheeler and Butowsky met with Trump\u2019s former press secretary Sean Spicer at the White House. The lawsuit included alleged quotes from Butowsky suggesting Trump himself had input on drafts of the Fox News story and was eager to see it published.The Fox News story included quotes attributed to Wheeler that said\u00a0he believed Rich communicated with WikiLeaks. Wheeler insists those quotes were fabricated, though he made comments similar to those included in the story in a television interview. The Fox News story also included the claim that an anonymous federal investigator confirmed Rich was in contact with WikiLeaks. Rich\u2019s family and D.C. police denounced the article almost immediately.Fox News retracted the story on May 23. The network released a statement saying the article was \u201cnot initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting.\u201d In the wake of the lawsuit, the network\u2019s president of news Jay Wallace released a statement that said \u201cthe accusation that foxnews.com published Malia Zimmerman\u2019s story to help detract from coverage of the Russia collusion issue is completely erroneous.\u201d Wallace further said the network\u2019s internal investigation into the matter found no evidence that Wheeler was misquoted. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has said Trump had \u201cno knowledge of the story and it is completely untrue that there was White House involvement in the story.\u201dConspiracies about Rich were widespread online after his death. But prior to its retraction, the Fox News story was the first mainstream news article to bolster the theories.Based on Feinberg\u2019s story, his bosses at Sputnik asked him to bring up the Fox News article in the briefing three days after the story was retracted. While Feinberg said his editor did not directly bring up the Fox News story he felt the implication was clear since the article was the only alleged new development in the Rich case.\u201cThey didn\u2019t mention the Fox story, but it was clear what they were talking about with \u2018revelations,\u2019\u201d Feinberg said.According to Feinberg, he responded with \u201ca hard no\u201d and was then handed his walking papers.\u201cIt was the same meeting. It was, \u2018We want you to do this.\u2019 I said, \u2018No.\u2019 They said, \u2018We have a termination letter for you,\u2019\u201d Feinberg recounted.Feinberg said the meeting included his editor, Peter Martinichev, and a man he\u2019d never seen before named Mikhail Safronov, who identified himself as Sputnik\u2019s D.C. bureau chief.\u201cI never saw him in the office before,\u201d Feinberg said of Safronov.Feinberg first discussed his departure from Sputnik with Yahoo News on May 26, the day he left the news outlet. At the time, Feinberg identified the Rich story as one of two main fake narratives he was asked to promote during his time at Sputnik. Feinberg said Sputnik also pressed him to ask questions that suggested the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad was not responsible for chemical attacks in that country. There is firm evidence linking Assad to chemical weapons but he has denied responsibility. Assad is a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.On the day he left Sputnik, Feinberg said his editors pressured him to ask about Rich at the briefing throughout his final week on the job.\u201cThis week they were pushing on Seth Rich. They were pushing on Seth Rich and I kept saying no,\u201d Feinberg said in the May conversation.View photosRussian President Vladimir Putin addresses employees of Rossiya Segodnya media holding (Sputnik) in Moscow\u00a0in 2016. (Photo: Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)MoreSputnik did not respond to a request for comment on this story. The company is operated by Rossiya Segodnya, a news conglomerate that is wholly owned by the Russian government. Rossiya Segodnya was established by an executive order from Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2013. Sputnik\u2019s website describes the company as being \u201centirely geared toward foreign audiences\u201d and dedicated to providing \u201calternative news content.\u201d The U.S. intelligence community labeled Sputnik and Russia\u2019s other foreign media outlets as a key part of Moscow\u2019s propaganda machine in its report on Kremlin interference in the 2016 presidential election. That report alleged Sputnik and other English-language Russian media companies worked in concert with online trolls and bots to advance narratives and conspiracy theories as part of an influence campaign designed to aid Trump.Update (7/5/17 4:06pm):\u00a0Beverly Hunt, a spokesperson for Sputnik, contacted Yahoo News on Friday evening, two days after this article was published, to dispute some of Feinberg\u2019s claims.\u201cAndrew willingly entered into an at-will employment agreement.\u00a0 Sputnik elected not to renew his agreement,\u201d Hunt said.\u00a0\u201cAndrew\u2019s contract was not renewed due to performance related issues.\u201dFeinberg responded by claiming he was never given a reason for his dismissal.\u201cIf there were any issues with my performance during my tenure at Sputnik, I never heard a single word from any of my supervisors about them up until the minute I was fired. Even then, I was not given a reason for them letting me go,\u201d Feinberg said._____Read more from Yahoo News:Middletown, Ohio, a city under siege: \u2018Everyone I know is on heroin\u2019Trump endorses bill that would slash legal immigrationTrump signs \u2018flawed\u2019 Russia sanctions, rips CongressMacron\u2019s shocking win inspires Americans plotting independent 2020 bidPhotos: In Middletown, addiction\u2019s toll: Faces, places \u2014 and headstonesReblogShareTweetSharePopular in the CommunityJim Plunkett taking 13 pills a day, in constant pain: 'My life sucks'3,398 reactions8%59%33%Revelers take part in Belfast Gay Pride parade27 reactions6%72%22%Hilary Duff Tells Body-Shaming Critics to \u2018Kiss My A**\u2019 in Swimsuit Photo2,772 reactions15%65%20%Transgender 8-Year-Old Sues Private School for \u2018Emotional Distress\u20193,548 reactions4%59%37%Fire at Torch Tower in Dubai226 reactions4%81%15%Man stranded in Arizona desert after car breaks down3 reactions0%100%0%Luis Fonsi On Justin Bieber's Spanish, 'Despacito' Hitting No. 1582 reactions4%79%17%Security for Trump's summer visit ruffles tranquil New Jersey town714 reactions4%73%23%Vicente Fox trolls Trump again, slams his 17-day vacation: 'If you're not happy with your job, just leave'2,839 reactions4%67%29%Here's how much money it takes to be rich in America1,817 reactions8%73%19%Chicago holds annual Rubber Duck Race in Chicago River36 reactions3%75%22%Rep.
