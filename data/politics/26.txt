CREDIT: AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko, poolPresident Donald Trump parroted Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev Thursday morning, blaming Congress for what he called a \u201cvery dangerous low\u201d in U.S. Russia relations.Trump signed new sanctions, which passed Congress with a veto-proof majority, into law Wednesday. The White House lobbied against the sanctions after the bill passed the Senate, and when Trump signed the bill into law, he released a statement expressing his concerns with the legislation.The law both imposes economic sanctions on Russia as well as restricting Trump\u2019s ability to lift sanctions placed on the country.\u201cThe bill remains seriously flawed,\u201d the statement said, \u201cparticularly because it encroaches on the executive branch\u2019s authority to negotiate.\u201dOn Thursday morning, Trump made it clear he signed the sanctions into law under duress, tweeting, \u201cOur relationship with Russia is at an all-time & very dangerous low. You can thank Congress, the same people that can\u2019t even give us HCare!\u201dOur relationship with Russia is at an all-time & very dangerous low. You can thank Congress, the same people that can't even give us HCare!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 3, 2017Trump wasn\u2019t the first world leader to blame Congress for the sanctions.\u201cThe Trump administration has shown its total weakness by handing over executive power to Congress in the most humiliating way,\u201d Medvedev tweeted Wednesday afternoon. \u201cThe US establishment fully outwitted Trump. The President is not happy about the sanctions, yet he could not but sign the bill.\u201dThe Trump administration has shown its total weakness by handing over executive power to Congress in the most humiliating way\u2014 Dmitry Medvedev (@MedvedevRussiaE) August 2, 2017The US establishment fully outwitted Trump.

On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence tweeted a video in which he talked about how Trump will \u201ccontinue to hold Russia accountable for its actions.\u201dThe U.S will continue to hold Russia accountable for its actions. #VPinEurope https://t.co/AlEL1fCXvP\u2014 Vice President Pence (@VP) August 2, 2017While Trump has been vocal about his opposition to the sanctions, he has not made any public comment about Russia\u2019s retaliation, a move by President Vladimir Putin that significantly downsizes U.S. diplomatic missions in Russia.The newly-imposed sanctions\u2014a bill the White House actively worked against\u2014is the first major legislative action of the Trump era, after Congress failed on several occasions to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.AboutCareersTipsEmailMasthead Think Progress Inline LogoFacebookTwitterYoutubeInstagram\u00a9 2017 ThinkProgress"}
