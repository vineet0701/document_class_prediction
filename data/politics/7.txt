In the call, Trump was referencing the state\u2019s high opioid death rate and his need for Mexico to rein in drug cartels sending drugs across its border with the U.S. While Trump won the state in the Republican primary, he lost it to Hillary Clinton in the general election. In response, Gov. Chris Sununu released a statement: \u201cThe President is wrong. It\u2019s disappointing his mischaracterization of this epidemic ignores the great things this state has to offer... We are already seeing positive signs of our efforts as overdoses and deaths are declining in key parts of the state. In spite of this crisis, New Hampshire remains the best place to live, work and raise a family.\u201dRead it at The Washington PostTrump: I Won New Hampshire Since It\u2019s a \u2018Drug-Infested Den\u2019Cheat Sheet \u00aePoliticsEntertainmentWorld NewsDrink and FoodArts and CultureU.S. NewsTechAboutAdvertiseContactJobsHelpPrivacyCode of Ethics & StandardsTerms & ConditionsCopyright & TrademarkSitemap\u00a9 2017 The Daily Beast Company LLC"}
