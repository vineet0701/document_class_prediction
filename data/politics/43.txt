Newkirk II7:00 AM ET If Everyone Ate Beans Instead of Beef James HamblinAug 2, 2017David FrumAug 3, 2017 PoliticsShareTweet\u2026LinkedInEmailPrintText SizeLeaking the transcript of a presidential call to a foreign leader is unprecedented, shocking, and dangerous. It is vitally important that a president be able to speak confidentially\u2014and perhaps even more important that foreign leaders understand that they can reply in confidence.Thursday\u2019s leak to The Washington Post of President Trump\u2019s calls with the president of Mexico and the prime minister of Australia will reverberate around the world. No leader will again speak candidly on the phone to Washington, D.C.\u2014at least for the duration of this presidency, and perhaps for longer. If these calls can be leaked, any call can be leaked\u2014and no leader dare say anything to the president of the United States that he or she would not wish to read in the news at home.In March, I warned about the risk of judicial overreach:In response to the danger posed by Trump, other American power holders will be tempted to jettison their historic role too, and use any tool at hand\u2014no matter how doubtfully legitimate\u2014to stop him. Those alternative power holders may even ultimately win. But in winning, they may discover themselves in the same tragic position as that Vietnam-era army officer who supposedly said: \u201cWe had to destroy the village in order to save it.\u201dThe risk of national-security establishment overreach looms even larger. The temptation is obvious: Senior national-security professionals regard Trump as something between (at best) a reckless incompetent doofus and (at worst) an outright Russian espionage asset. The fear that a Russian mole has burrowed into the Oval Office may justify, to some, the most extreme actions against that suspected mole.The nature of this particular leak suggests just such a national-security establishment origin. It is a very elegantly designed leak. The two transcripts belong to calls whose substance was already widely reported in the media; they give away nothing new.Better still from a national-security establishment point of view: both calls make the foreign leader look good at home. Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto will be helped, not hurt, by his dignified defense of Mexican national interests; Malcolm Turnbull is shown being simultaneously compassionate to deserving refugees but stern in his defense of Australian law and preexisting agreements with the United States.Best of all, from that same national-security point of view, the transcripts reveal Trump as an arrant fool without actually compromising any important U.S. national interest. Speaking to the president of Mexico, Trump claims he won the state of New Hampshire because it is a \u201cdrug-infested den.\u201d Trump won the state\u2019s Republican primary, but lost New Hampshire in 2016, and that quote will not help him do better in 2020. The Turnbull transcript confirms the accuracy of early reports that Trump erupted in temper\u2014and exposes Trump\u2019s claims about the call as untrue. \"Thank you to Prime Minister of Australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about. Very nice!\u201d he tweeted on February 3. But the transcript records him saying: \"As far as I am concerned that is enough Malcom. I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.\"But if no high national-security secret has been betrayed in these transcripts, the workings of the U.S. government have been gravely compromised, and in ways that will be very difficult to repair even after Trump leaves office. Trump\u2019s violation of basic norms of government has driven people who would otherwise uphold those norms unto death to violate them in their turn. Contempt for Trump\u2019s misconduct inspires counter-misconduct.Nor is that the end. The less Trump can trust the regularly constituted government, the more justified he will feel in working irregularly. His irregular actions then justify more counter-irregularity from the rest of the government.Donald Trump has launched the executive branch into a cycle of self-destruction for which he bears ultimate blame\u2014but whose ultimate cost will be borne by his successors and the American nation.ShareTweetCommentsLatest VideoWhat Does 'Late Capitalism' Really Mean?

TwengeMore comfortable online than out partying, post-Millennials are safer, physically, than adolescents have ever been. But they\u2019re on the brink of a mental-health crisis.One day last summer, around noon, I called Athena, a 13-year-old who lives in Houston, Texas. She answered her phone\u2014she\u2019s had an iPhone since she was 11\u2014sounding as if she\u2019d just woken up. We chatted about her favorite songs and TV shows, and I asked her what she likes to do with her friends. \u201cWe go to the mall,\u201d she said. \u201cDo your parents drop you off?,\u201d I asked, recalling my own middle-school days, in the 1980s, when I\u2019d enjoy a few parent-free hours shopping with my friends. \u201cNo\u2014I go with my family,\u201d she replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll go with my mom and brothers and walk a little behind them. I just have to tell my mom where we\u2019re going. I have to check in every hour or every 30 minutes.\u201dThose mall trips are infrequent\u2014about once a month. More often, Athena and her friends spend time together on their phones, unchaperoned. Unlike the teens of my generation, who might have spent an evening tying up the family landline with gossip, they talk on Snapchat, the smartphone app that allows users to send pictures and videos that quickly disappear. They make sure to keep up their Snapstreaks, which show how many days in a row they have Snapchatted with each other. Sometimes they save screenshots of particularly ridiculous pictures of friends. \u201cIt\u2019s good blackmail,\u201d Athena said. (Because she\u2019s a minor, I\u2019m not using her real name.) She told me she\u2019d spent most of the summer hanging out alone in her room with her phone. That\u2019s just the way her generation is, she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a choice to know any life without iPads or iPhones. I think we like our phones more than we like actual people.\u201d Continue Reading Getty ImagesThe Lost Cause Rides AgainTa-Nehisi CoatesHBO\u2019s Confederate takes as its premise an ugly truth that black Americans are forced to live every day: What if the Confederacy wasn\u2019t wholly defeated?HBO\u2019s prospective series Confederate will offer an alternative history of post-Civil War America. It will ask the question, according to co-creator David Benioff, \u00a0\u201cWhat would the world have looked like \u2026 if the South had won?\u201d A swirl of virtual protests and op-eds have greeted this proposed premise. In response, HBO has expressed \u201cgreat respect\u201d for its critics but also said it hopes that they will \u201creserve judgment until there is something to see.\u201dThis request sounds sensible at first pass. Should one not \u201creserve judgment\u201d of a thing until after it has been seen? But HBO does not actually want the public to reserve judgment so much as it wants the public to make a positive judgment. A major entertainment company does not announce a big new show in hopes of garnering dispassionate nods of acknowledgement. HBO executives themselves judged Confederate before they\u2019d seen it\u2014they had to, as no television script actually exists. HBO hoped to communicate that approval to its audience through the announcement. And had that communication been successful, had Confederate been greeted with rapturous anticipation, it is hard to imagine the network asking its audience to tamp down and wait.

McMasterRosie GrayRumors have circulated for days that the national-security adviser\u2019s job is on the line, and the pro-Trump media have launched an all-out assault against him.Updated on August 5 at 11:51 a.m. ETLong-simmering tensions within the White House burst into public view this week after the firings of three National Security Council officials, resulting in National-Security Adviser H.R. McMaster becoming Public Enemy No. 1 of the pro-Trump online brigades.McMaster has cleaned house at the NSC over the past few weeks. Via his deputy Ricky Waddell, he fired director of strategic planning Rich Higgins last month over a memo Higgins wrote alleging a deep-state conspiracy against President Trump. McMaster then dismissed two top officials brought on by the previous national-security adviser, Michael Flynn: the NSC\u2019s senior director for the Middle East, Derek Harvey, who was fired last week; and the senior director for intelligence programs, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, who was let go on Wednesday. Continue Reading Molly Riley / ReutersThe Myth of Reverse RacismVann R. Newkirk IIThe idea of white victimhood is increasingly central to the debate over affirmative action.Contrary to initial indications, the civil-rights division of the Department of Justice won\u2019t be dismantling affirmative action after all. At least, that\u2019s the current word from Trump administration officials, after a New York Times article claimed the department would be using the broad powers of justice to take on universities that it decided had discriminated against white people. The DOJ since clarified that it was gearing up to investigate complaints from dozens of organizations alleging that certain universities used quotas\u2014which are illegal\u2014to limit the number of Asian American enrollees.Still, the beacons have been lit, and America\u2019s annual heated argument about affirmative action has begun anew, this time against the background of racial tensions that have helped define the early goings of the Trump presidency. As always, those tensions and long-held beliefs about racial advantages rule the debate.

Named in 2011, the American Psychological Association recently described it as the dread and helplessness that come with \u201cwatching the slow and seemingly irrevocable impacts of climate change unfold, and worrying about the future for oneself, children, and later generations.\u201dIt\u2019s not a formal diagnosis. Anxiety is traditionally defined by an outsized stress response to a given stimulus. In this case, the stimulus is real, as are the deleterious effects of stress on the body.This sort of disposition toward ecological-based distress does not pair well with a president who has denied the reality of the basis for this anxiety. Donald Trump has called climate change a fabrication on the part of \u201cthe Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\u201d He has also led the United States to become the only G20 country that will not honor the Paris Climate Accord, and who has appointed fossil-fuel advocates to lead the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency. Continue Reading Andr\u00e9 CarrilhoThe Whitest Music EverJames ParkerProg rock was audacious, innovative\u2014and awful.\u201cWe are the most uncool people in Miami.\u201d So begins, promisingly enough, David Weigel\u2019s The Show That Never Ends: The Rise and Fall of Prog Rock. Weigel, along with 3,000 fellow Yes-heads, Rush-oids, Tull freaks, and votaries of King Crimson\u2014cultural underdogs all, twitching and grimacing with revenge-of-the-nerds excitement\u2014is at the port of Miami, about to embark on a five-day progressive-rock-themed cruise: a floating orgy of some of the most despised music ever produced by long-haired white men.Do you like prog rock, the extravagantly conceptual and wildly technical post-psychedelic subgenre that ruled the world for about 30 seconds in the early 1970s before being torn to pieces by the starving street dogs of punk rock? Do you like the proggers, with their terrible pampered proficiency, their priestly robes, and their air\u2014once they get behind their instruments\u2014of an inverted, almost abscessed Englishness? I don\u2019t. At least, I think I don\u2019t. I like Queen\u2019s \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d which is a kind of wonderful satirical compression of prog rock, a fast-forward operetta with goofy existentialist trappings and a heavy-metal blowout in the middle; I like the bit of Mike Oldfield\u2019s Tubular Bells that became the theme music for The Exorcist. And there are contemporary bands I adore that have been grazed by prog: the moody, alchemical Tool, the obtuse and crushing Meshuggah. But for naked prog, the thing itself, I seem to lack the mettle. The trapped, eunuch ferocity of Geddy Lee\u2019s voice, squealing inside the nonsense clockwork of Rush, disturbs me. And Yes\u2019s Tales From Topographic Oceans is an experience to me unintelligible and close to unbearable, like being read aloud a lengthy passage of prose with no verbs in it.

Between the Senate\u2019s late-night \u201cdamn the torpedoes\u201d voting frenzy to repeal something, anything, from Obamacare, and the president\u2019s early morning tweets proclaiming his \u201ccomplete power\u201d to pardon himself and his relatives, what used to be business as usual in Washington never looked so good.It is comforting to think that Trump is the only thing standing between us and the good old dysfunctional ways of Washington. But I have my doubts. The president\u2019s disruption engine is powered by three paradoxes. Each was made possible by technological innovations. All will endure long after this ringmaster moves his circus to another town. Continue Reading Jonathan Ernst / ReutersTrump Has Quietly Accomplished More Than It AppearsDavid A. GrahamThe chaos, legislative fumbling, and legal jeopardy should not obscure the ways that the administration is remaking federal policy in consequential ways.Imagine, if you will, that there is a shadow government.The actual government, the administration of Donald Trump, is coming off the worst week of his presidency, although there haven\u2019t been any smooth weeks. Trump\u2019s top legislative priority, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, seems dead for the moment. (Tax reform? Forget it.) His administration has set a new standard for chaos and dysfunction, rolling through staffers the way other administrations run through, well, legislative initiatives. Trump\u2019s foreign policy remains inchoate and ineffective. Meanwhile, a special counsel investigation looms over the entire administration, threatening both its legitimacy and legal jeopardy for some of its members.

Instead, she wound up having a fight with the man she refers to as her \u201cso-called boyfriend.\u201d He was a high-school classmate who had recently ended up on the street, so Sweatt had let him move in, under the proviso that he not do drugs in the apartment.

As he walked through halls full of ancient bones, he had no idea that a week later, he\u2019d add to their ranks by finding one of the most spectacular dinosaur fossils of all time. It\u2019s an animal so well preserved that its skeleton can\u2019t be seen for the skin and soft tissues that still cover it.When we look at dinosaurs in museums, it takes imagination to plaster flesh and skin on top of the bones. But for the dinosaur that Funk unearthed\u2014a 110-million-year-old creature named Borealopelta\u2014imagination isn\u2019t necessary. It looks like a sculpture. And based on pigments that still lurk within the skin, scientists think they know what colors the animal had. \u201cIf someone wants to come face to face with a dinosaur, and see what it actually looked like, this is the one for that,\u201d says Caleb Brown from the Royal Tyrrell Museum, who has studied the animal.
