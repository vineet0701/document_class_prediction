He\u2019ll be heading to his New Jersey golf course for a 17-day trip in what appears to be a contradiction of his previous statements about vacations.During his presidential election campaign, Trump told voters: \u201cI would rarely leave the White House because there\u2019s so much work to be done. I would not be a president who took vacations. I would not be a president that takes time off.\u201d Daily Emails and Alerts - Get the best of Newsweek delivered to your inboxOn another occasion, the president tweeted a quote from his book that suggested people who loved their jobs should not be taking vacations.\u201cDon\u2019t take vacations. What\u2019s the point? If you\u2019re not enjoying your work, you\u2019re in the wrong job.\u201d\u00a0\u2014Think Like a Billionaire\u2014Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2012His suggestion followed a number of tweets critical of President Barack Obama for taking holidays or playing golf, while lamenting the amount of taxpayer dollars it cost for Obama to take a vacation.\u201cWhen will Obama next go on vacation if he wins the election? The day after,\u201d Trump tweeted back in 2012.\u201cPresident Obama has a major meeting on the N.Y.C. Ebola outbreak, with people flying in from all over the country, but decided to play golf!\u201d he said on Twitter in 2014.Trump also hit the Obamas for wasting taxpayer money with their vacations, tweeting in 2012: \u201cThe Obama\u2019s Spain vacation cost taxpayers over $476K. They love to spend money.\u201dHowever, Trump\u2019s own vacations, coupled with weekend trips to his Mar-a-Lago resort, which he has dubbed the Winter White House, have seen him spend far more than Obama did on holidays.Indeed, according to a report from CNN, Trump was estimated to have spent more than $20 million during his first 80 days as president on trips to his Florida resort. This puts Trump on track to have spent more on travel during his first years as president than Obama did during his eight years in the role.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most ReadThe NewsletterExclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.SubscribeRelated Stories Trump Is a Terrible POTUS, According to His Own Twitter Will Melania \u2018Feud\u2019 With Prince Harry Like Obamas?
