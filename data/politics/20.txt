The vote is scheduled for Thursday and Friday.The plant has been accused by some workers of discriminating against African American employees, who make up a majority of the plant\u2019s workforce.

The company is also telling those undecided about the union that their pro-union co-workers would cost them their jobs.\u201dSanders cited accusations of supervisors holding meetings with workers as a means of interrogation, as well as disparaging the UAW and even playing anti-union videos in breakrooms.\u201cThis could go down as one of the most vicious, and illegal, anti-union crusades in decades,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWorkers should never have to endure this type of threatening campaign or walk through a minefield just to vote for a union. \u201dNissan has denied using intimidation tactics.According to Sanders, corporations like Nissan take advantage of poorer states like Mississippi, which has 30 percent of children living in poverty and an average weekly wage of $727.However, the plant is somewhat divided over the issue as the voting takes place. Some workers have claimed discrimination to be a factor at the plant, but others point to an improvement in the African-American community since Nissan opened the plant in 2003.\u201cBlack people are doing much better here since Nissan came,\u201d\u00a052-year-old Tony Jacobson, who is black and has worked at the plant since it opened, told Reuters. \"I'm trying to save our livelihoods, I don't want Canton to be like Detroit.\"Becoming \u201clike Detroit\u201d is another issue that hangs in the balance for the UAW. The union, which has struggled to add membership, is facing negotiations with Detroit\u2019s Big Three carmakers in 2019, and a defeat in Canton could hinder the long-term goal of uniting autoworkers in the South.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most ReadThe NewsletterExclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.SubscribeRelated Stories Bernie Sanders Says Liberals Shouldn't Trust DemocratsMost Read \u00a9 2017 Newsweek LLC Sign up For The NewsletterAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsNewsweek Media GroupCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues Subscribe July 28 Issue Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit Is A Missed Opportunity The Duplass Brothers Talk New HBO Series 'Room 104' Cancer Treatment Is Changing: Meet the People Rebelling July 21 Issue Trump Could Stop Chinese Companies Backing North Korea 'Game of Thrones': Gwendoline Christie on Season 7 Despite CNN Jab, Trump Loves Big Media July 14 Issue ISIS's Indoctrinated Kids: A Future of Violent Jihad?
