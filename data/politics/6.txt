McMaster? By Graham Lanktree On 8/3/17 at 8:50 AM Close U.S. Donald Trump H.R. McMaster Alt-Right White House U.S. PoliticsFar-right American nationalists have launched a campaign to smear President Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser H.R. McMaster after he fired a number of their allies from the National Security Council.Mike Cernovich, a figurehead of the so-called alt-right nationalist movement\u2014a loose-knit group of racist white nationalists, conspiracy theorists\u00a0and misogynists\u2014launched the website McMasterLeaks.com Wednesday to solicit dirt on Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster from inside and outside the White House.The website does not have a secure drop box to submit leaks or any comment space to post them and consists of a single post of mostly unsubstantiated claims. Daily Emails and Alerts - Get the best of Newsweek delivered to your inboxThe alt-right\u2019s beef with McMaster stems from his firing of Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the NSC\u2019s\u00a0senior director for intelligence programs; Rich Higgins, the NSC\u2019s director for strategic planning; and Derek Harvey, the NSC\u2019s senior director for the Middle East.\u201cMCMASTER PURGES NSC STAFFER FOR WARNING OF ISLAMIST-LEFTIST THREAT,\u201d Cernovich tweeted Wednesday using the hashtag #McMasterFacts. U.S. national security adviser H.R. McMaster at the White House in Washington, D.C., on July 31. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters The hashtag and attacks against McMaster\u2019s character quickly began gaining momentum among alt-right figures. Jack Posobiec, known for his promotion of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, a claim that Democrats were running a pedophile ring out of a Washington, D.C., pizza parlor, attempted to draw a connection between McMaster and the release of the Access Hollywood tape last October in which Trump said he could \u201cdo anything\u201d to women, even \u201cgrab them by the pussy.\u201dRelated: The purge: White House official with ties to Michael Flynn firedCernovich\u2019s tear against McMaster follows the national security adviser\u2019s hand in firing Higgins, who was let go on July 21 after he argued in a May memo circulated in the NSC that Trump\u2019s agenda is being sabotaged by globalists and Islamists who are leading a \u201cMaoist insurgency\u201d that has led \u201cIslamists [to] ally with cultural Marxists\u201d in an effort to destroy America. The memo is excerpted in The Atlantic.\u00a0In March, CIA leaders also warned McMaster about Cohen-Watnick, who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Trump's fired national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and derided in intelligence circles as one of the \u201cFlynnstones.\u201d Cohen-Watnick was implicated in an intelligence leak by House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes to back up Trump\u2019s claim that former\u00a0President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower in New York during the election. The claim has been dismissed by former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.Trump\u2019s top advisers, Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner, blocked McMaster\u2019s initial attempts to remove Cohen-Watnick after the scandal. Bannon and Kushner got Trump to intervene to save Cohen-Watnick\u2019s\u00a0job. Bannon, the former executive chair of the far-right news outlet Breitbart, said during the 2016 election campaign that Breitbart serves as a platform for the alt-right.Last week, Derek Harvey, the NSC\u2019s top Middle East adviser\u00a0and a Bannon ally, was also let go.Flynn\u2019s son Michael Flynn Jr. has long criticized McMaster, who replaced his father, citing the general\u2019s aversion to the phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Members of Trump\u2019s staff and alt-right supporters have criticized McMaster\u2019s push for Trump to curb his use of the phrase to avoid\u00a0alienating Muslim communities. They say it is politically correct and too soft on Islam, which they see as responsible for the rise of extremist groups like the so-called Islamic State and Al-Qaeda.Bannon, Flynn\u00a0and members of the alt-right see the U.S. pitted in an existential global battle against Islam.\u201cMcMaster seems out of sync with Trump, Trump's agenda, and the base. He has to go,\u201d tweeted Trump promoter Jeff Giesea recently. Giesea has criticized McMaster for not removing NSC staff that he sees as holdovers from the Obama administration, tweeting last week that McMaster\u2019s claim that \u201cthere is no such thing as a holdover\u201d is \u201cone of his more asinine remarks.\u201dIt is common for intelligence and military officials to serve across administrations. When he first became president\u00a0in 2009,\u00a0Obama kept many Bush administration officials, including Robert Gates as secretary of defense, and later appointed John Brennen, George W. Bush\u2019s National Counterterrorism Center director, to lead the CIA. Countless military and intelligence officials serve under Republicans and Democrats across administrations.For the alt-right, McMaster\u2019s firing of their allies was the last straw in their campaign against him.In the first post on his McMasterLeaks.com website, Cernovich published a comic by hard-right nationalist cartoonist Ben Garrison. It shows McMaster and Retired United States Army General David Petraeus being controlled like marionettes by Jewish financier George Soros.\u201cMcMaster's 'butler'\u00a0Joel Rayburn is running off the books intelligence operation against Trump loyalists,\u201d Cernovich claimed on Twitter late Wednesday. Cernovich also retweeted a picture of McMaster in silhouette in the position of Islamic prayer.Cernovich accused McMaster of refusing \u201cto get rid of Obama holdovers who spied in [sic] Trump\u201d and firing other \u201cpro-Trump loyalists.\u201d Cernovich also made a series of unsubstantiated and unsourced claims, including\u00a0\u201cMcMaster has been leaking information to David Petraeus and has had direct contact with George Soros.\"Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most ReadThe NewsletterExclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.SubscribeRelated Stories Donald Trump and the Agony of H.R.
