And it appears Democrats now appreciate the Arizona senator much more than Republicans.A new Quinnipiac poll showed 39% of Republican voters held a positive view of McCain and 49% held a negative view. By contrast, Democratic voters hold a 74% positive view of McCain compared to 18% negative, for a plus-56 net rating.Overall, the poll showed McCain has a net plus-25 favorability rating from all people surveyed \u2014 57% positive to 32% negative.McCain's return to Washington just a week after announcing a brain cancer diagnosis helped Republicans bring their various Obamacare repeal plans to the floor of the Senate for a vote. McCain voted for\u00a0a bill to\u00a0repeal and replace Obamacare called\u00a0the Better Care Reconciliation Act, but against\u00a0both a repeal-only and \"skinny\" repeal bill.The vote against the \"skinny\" repeal bill sank the Republican hopes of getting any sort of legislation passed.McCain argued\u00a0the bill\u00a0would not bring down costs or improve care for Americans. He also criticized the party-line approach the GOP used to try to pass the bill.According to the Congressional Budget Office, the skinny repeal bill would have resulted in 16 million more uninsured Americans by 2026 than under the current baseline.Collins and Murkowski have also gotten approval following their votes. Collins was applauded\u00a0in the airport upon her return to Maine, while more than 200 people showed up for a \"Thank You Lisa\" rally in Alaska for Murkowski.Lawmakers have begun\u00a0considering bipartisan approaches\u00a0to shoring\u00a0up Obamacare marketplaces instead of trying to overhaul the law.NOW WATCH: Watch the most bizarre moments from Trump\u2019s speech to the Boy Scouts of AmericaMore From Business Insider 'No, stop for a second!': Trump budget chief gets in fiery exchange with CNN's Chris Cuomo over critical Obamacare payments\"It was like the scene from 'Gladiator'\": Senators detail 'roller coaster' healthcare vote'I very clearly projected my own sensitivities': JK Rowling apologises for accusing Trump of ignoring a disabled boyReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTrump slammed this GOP senator in a tweet\u2014and it might've been a bad ideaMashableOne vulnerable Republican senator just got brutal poll numbers after his vote on the Republican healthcare billBusiness InsiderBarack Obama\u2019s Birthday Message From Michelle Will Make You Forget About the Trump PresidencyNewsweekJeff Sessions\u2019s Leak Probe Press Conference Was MisleadingNewsweekKeystone XL Foes Don\u2019t Mention Climate in Red State Pipeline BattleBloombergOfficial: Fast negotiations led to professor's surrenderAssociated PressHere's how much money it takes to be rich in AmericaYahoo FinanceOne way Trump is outperforming other presidentsYahoo FinanceFriday's jobs report was just great across the board: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoDow poised for new high following strong jobs reportYahoo FinanceNorth Korea's ICBM tests may be a deception tactic to hide a much more capable threatBusiness InsiderMeet the secretive German company that owns Panera, Peet's, Krispy Kreme and KeurigYahoo FinanceChina's and Russia's stealth fighters don't stand a chance against the F-35 and F-22Business InsiderHere's why gold is selling off and the dollar is surging: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoThe job market hits a key milestoneYahoo FinanceConor McGregor's sparring partner has quit after saying he feels 'exploited'Business InsiderAP FACT CHECK: Trump and his real, and unreal, phone callsAnonymous: All politicians lie, but the things Trump chooses to lie about are mystifying. \"Boy scouts called and said it was the greatest speech ever\", I mean why even lie about that?Join the Conversation1 / 5967The one variable that best explains the retirement crisisYahoo FinanceTrump weighs slashing one of the most popular tax deductionsYahoo FinanceCrude oil is frustrating traders, from Goldman to 'God': NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoStocks should tack on more summer gains after today's jobs report: traderYahoo FinanceBerkshire profit falls as underwriting loss offsets railroad gainsReutersPeople are ripping apart McDonald's latest attempt to win over millennialsBusiness InsiderRussia's 'sexiest motorcyclist,' Instagram star dies in crashAutoblogThe Fed might still hike in December, but not September: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoCall of the week: Why Facebook got hit with another sell ratingYahoo FinancePaul Ryan pushes back on Jeff Sessions' veiled threat to journalistsBusiness InsiderGOLDMAN SACHS: There's an overlooked way to make a fortune this earnings seasonBusiness InsiderYour fingerprint is now your baseball ticket at 6 ballparksYahoo FinanceWhy investors are dumping the dollar and health care stocksYahoo Finance VideoTODAY'S CHARTS: GoPro pops on revenue beat; Yelp surprises with profit; Weight Watchers wows with subscriber growthYahoo FinanceAn insanely popular 'healthy' ice cream brand is taking over America \u2014 but some experts are skepticalBusiness InsiderBig banks are going after Venmo and Venmo is winningYahoo Finance"}
