According to Scaramucci's financial disclosure report, his 43.8% share of the sale is worth at least $50 million; other estimates put that number even higher.Scaramucci's exact tax bill would depend on a number of factors, including the final value of the company, how much he invested in it over time and any offsetting capital losses.But at the top marginal long-term capital gains\u00a0rate of 20%\u00a0\u2014 plus a 3.8% surtax under the Affordable Care Act\u00a0\u2014 the\u00a0bill could be, conservatively, about $10 million\u00a0to $12 million.The Office of Government Ethics would not comment on Scaramucci's application for that special tax treatment. But certificates are a matter of public record, and no such certificate has been granted to Scaramucci. And under OGE regulations, the agency will only grant certificates to\u00a0current employees of the executive branch.That certificate allows a federal employee to reinvest the proceeds of the asset sale \u2014with capital gains taxes deferred \u2014 into U.S. Treasuries or a diversified mutual fund that would not present a conflict of interest.Related:\u00a0Anthony Scaramucci out as White House communications directorTrump's newest hire, Anthony Scaramucci, takes on Chief of Staff Reince PriebusThe rise and quick fall of Anthony Scaramucci: 4 lowlights from his 11 days at the White HouseThe Export-Import Bank, the federal agency where Scaramucci served as chief strategy officer and senior vice president before moving to the White House, said he officially left his job there July 25.SkyBridge announced it struck the deal with the Chinese company, HNA Group, in January \u2013\u00a0the same time Scaramucci said that he would\u00a0step down as the firm's\u00a0co-managing partner as he prepared\u00a0to take a\u00a0different senior job within the Trump administration.Trump's then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and other staffers had blocked his appointment \u2014\u00a0a point Scaramucci appears to reference\u00a0in crude and colorful language\u00a0in a now-infamous rant to the New Yorker.\u00a0Priebus was ultimately overruled when Trump brought in Scaramucci as communications director on July 21.\u00a0Yet Scaramucci left\u00a0his White House job Monday \u2013 the same day Trump brought on his new chief of staff, John Kelly \u2014 before a certificate of divestiture could be issued.Even though SkyBridge made the announcement of its sale in January, it's been held up by a legally mandated national security review. \u00a0Cancelling the sale\u00a0is not an option, both SkyBridge and HNA Group\u00a0say.\u00a0\"Recent developments with Anthony Scaramucci and his role within the administration have no impact on our business and/or the transaction with HNA,\" SkyBridge said in a statement.\u00a0\"The news about Anthony Scaramucci leaving his role as White House communications director has no impact on HNA\u2019s commitment to closing the SkyBridge transaction as soon as possible,\" said Bob Rendine, an HNA spokesman. \"We fully expect it to move forward and there is no change from our hope that it will be closed by the end of the summer.\"Scaramucci and his lawyer did not return several messages seeking comment.Scaramucci did work in the administration\u00a0just long enough to be bound by the post-employment restrictions under President Trump's executive order on ethics in the executive branch.Scaramucci signed an ethics pledge barring him from working as a lobbyist for five years after leaving government \u2014 and from ever representing a foreign government. The White House said he hasn\u2019t requested or received any waiver from the ethics pledge.Scaramucci had scheduled an announcement about his future for Friday, but later canceled. \"Focusing on Family, My Work in The Private Sector,\" he tweeted Thursday. \"Stay Tuned!\"Contributing: Fredreka Schouten.Skip in SkipxEmbedxShareCLOSETRUMP ADMINISTRATION SHAKEUPSScaramucci out as White House communications director | 0:43Anthony Scaramucci, known as \"the Mooch,\" left President Donald Trump's White House less than two weeks after he was hired.
