That, in turn, has prompted a sharp retort from top Republicans and Democrats alike. | Alex Wong/Getty ImagesBipartisan bills unveiled to protect Mueller By DARREN SAMUELSOHN08/03/2017 02:06 PM EDT Share on Facebook Share on TwitterCompeting bipartisan Senate bills introduced Thursday put President Donald Trump on further notice that any move to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller wouldn\u2019t go down without a serious fight.The two pieces of legislation take different approaches but both have the same mission of requiring judicial review of any move to oust Mueller, who is leading the independent probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.Story Continued BelowOne of the measures, introduced by Senate Judiciary Committee members Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.), would let Mueller challenge his firing by a panel of three federal judges \u2014 but only after he\u2019s been terminated. By contrast, a different proposal from Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) would force the top Justice Department officials who were tasked with firing Mueller to go before the judicial panel before he\u2019s even terminated to explain their reasons for the move.Trump has long complained about the different Russia investigations, which have heightened tensions in Washington and distracted from the Republican\u2019s policy goals. He\u2019s also criticized Mueller for hiring multiple attorneys who have contributed to Democratic candidates and questioned whether Mueller has a close relationship with James Comey, the former FBI director who Trump fired in May. Sources close to both Mueller and Comey, however, have disputed that the two men are as close as the president has suggested.While Trump has stopped short of saying he plans to fire Mueller, his top aides have acknowledged the subject has come up. That, in turn, has prompted a sharp retort from top Republicans and Democrats alike.\u201cAny effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency unless Mueller did something wrong,\u201d Graham told reporters last week.The South Carolina Republican, who ran against Trump for the 2016 presidential nomination and also served in the late 1990s as an impeachment manager against President Bill Clinton, was joined in his bill introduction today by Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.Email Sign UpBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Tom Carper (D-Del.) told CNN that the bill \u201csends a pretty clear message\u201d to Trump that he would be sparking a much bigger fight if he did move to oust Mueller. \u201cIts symbolic,\u201d Carper said. \u201cBut is an important symbol. It\u2019s a bipartisan symbol.\u201dBeyond the prospect of Trump\u2019s veto pen, it\u2019s unclear how legislation to protect Mueller would fare on the other end of the Capitol.House Speaker Paul Ryan has said his \u201cbest advice\u201d to the president was to \u201clet Robert Mueller do his job.\u201dAt the same time, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) joined 19 other GOP lawmakers last week calling on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a new special counsel apart from Mueller to \u201cinvestigate a plethora of matters\u201d during the 2016 campaign related to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and senior Obama administration officials, including former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.
