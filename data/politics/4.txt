The White House directly contradicted President Trump's own attorney\u00a0on Tuesday. It confirmed that the president was involved in that misleading Donald Trump Jr. statement about his meeting with a Russian lawyer after Trump's attorney, Jay Sekulow, had issued two unmistakable comments asserting Trump wasn't. But this was hardly the first time that the Trump team has appeared to confirm something it previously denied. Below are nine examples. 1. That Trump was involved in Donald Trump Jr.'s Russia statement The denials \u201cI do want to be clear that the president was not involved in the drafting of the statement and did not issue the statement.\u201d \u2014 Sekulow on NBC News on July 16 \u201cThe president didn't sign off on anything. \u2026\u00a0The president wasn't involved in that.\u201d \u2014 Sekulow on ABC News on\u00a0July 12 The confirmation \u201cThe president weighed in as any father would, based on the limited information that he had.\u201d \u2014 White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, after The Washington Post reported that Trump had changed the statement at the last minute to be more misleading. President Trump personally dictated a statement that was issued after revelations that Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 election. The Washington Post's Philip Rucker and Carol D. Leonnig explain. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) 2. That Trump is thinking about\u00a0pardons The denial \u201cPardons are not being discussed and are not on the table.\u201d \u2014 Sekulow on July 21 The confirmation While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 22, 2017 3. That Trump decided unilaterally\u00a0to fire FBI Director James B. Comey The denials \u201cNo one from the White House. That was a DOJ decision.\u201d \u2014 Sean Spicer on May 9 Asked\u00a0whether Trump had already decided to\u00a0fire Comey and asked Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein and the Justice Department to craft a justification for it: \u201cNo.\u201d \u2014 Huckabee Sanders on May 10 \u201cHe\u00a0took the recommendation of his deputy attorney general,\u00a0who oversees the FBI director. \u2026 He has lost confidence in the FBI director, and\u00a0he took the recommendation of Rod J. Rosenstein.\u201d \u2014 Kellyanne Conway on May 10 The confirmations \u201cI was going to fire Comey \u2026 Oh,\u00a0I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.\u201d \u2014 Trump on NBC News\u00a0on May 11 \u201cOn May 8, I learned that President Trump intended to remove Director Comey and sought my advice and input.\u201d \u2014 Rosenstein on May 19 Since President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on May 9, the explanations for the dismissal have been getting murkier. Now Trump has tweeted a threat to cancel press briefings and a suggestion about \"tapes\" of his private conversations with Comey. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) 4. That Comey was fired because of the Russia investigation The denials \u201cThat's not what \u2014 let me be clear with you \u2014 that was not what this is about. That's not what this is about.\u201d \u2014 Vice President Pence on May 10 Rosenstein's memo contained no mention of the Russia investigation and instead focused on Comey's unusual announcements about the Hillary Clinton investigation during the 2016 campaign:\u00a0\u201cI cannot defend the Director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken.\u201d \u2014 Rosenstein on May 9 \u201cBased on my evaluation, and for the reasons expressed by the Deputy Attorney General in the attached memorandum, I have concluded that a fresh start is needed at the leadership of the FBI.\u201d \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a letter May 9 The confirmation \u201cAnd in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself \u2014 I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.\u201d \u2014 Trump to NBC on May 11 President Trump denied asking former FBI director James B. Comey for a loyalty pledge, or to end the FBI's investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, at a news conference on June 9 at the White House. (Reuters) 5. That Michael Flynn discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador The denial \u201cThey did not discuss anything having to do with the United States\u2019 decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia. \u2026 What I can confirm, having spoken to him about it, is that those conversations that happened to occur around the time that the United States took action to expel diplomats had nothing whatsoever to do with those sanctions.\u201d \u2014 Pence on Jan. 15 The confirmations Asked whether Flynn discussed sanctions related to Russia's alleged 2016 election interference: \u201cRight.\u201d \u2014 Spicer on Feb. 14 \u201cSo just to be clear, the acting attorney general informed the White House counsel that they wanted to give, quote, 'a heads-up' to us on some comments that may have seemed in conflict with what he had said to the vice president in particular.\u00a0\u2026 The issue, pure and simple, came down to a matter of trust, and the president concluded that he no longer had the trust of his national security adviser.\u201d \u2014 Spicer on Feb. 14 \u201cWhat I would tell you is that the vice president became aware of incomplete information that he'd received on February 9, last Thursday night, based on media accounts.\u201d \u2014 Pence spokesman Marc Lotter 6. That Trump's navy secretary nominee was going to withdraw The denial After CBS's Major Garrett reported that Navy secretary nominee Philip Bilden was likely to withdraw, Spicer tweeted on Feb. 18: Those people would be wrong. Just spoke with him and he is 100% commited to being the next SECNAV pending Senate confirm. https://t.co/AfRZfQQCzG \u2014 Sean Spicer (@PressSec) February 18, 2017 The confirmation \u201cMr. Philip Bilden has informed me that he has come to the difficult decision to withdraw from consideration to be secretary of the Navy.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Feb. 26 7. That Trump shared classified information with Russian leaders in the Oval Office The denial \u201cThe story that came out tonight, as reported, is false.\u201d \u2014 national security adviser H.R. McMaster on May 15 The confirmations \u201cIt is wholly appropriate for the president to share whatever information he thinks is necessary to advance the security of the American people. That\u2019s what he did.\u201d \u2014 McMaster on May 16 As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017 8. That intelligence officials\u00a0briefed Trump on an unconfirmed dossier that suggested Russia had compromising info on him The denial \"And [the story] says that they never briefed him on it, that\u00a0they appended two pages to the bottom of his intelligence report. ... [Trump]\u00a0has said that he is not aware of that.\" - Kellyanne Conway on Seth Meyers's show on Jan. 10. (The report had said he was, in fact, briefed.) The confirmation \"I think [Comey] shared it so that I would \u2014 because the other three people left, and he showed it to me. ... So anyway, in my opinion, he shared it so that I would think he had it out there.\" Asked whether it was used as leverage: \"Yeah I think so.\" - Trump to the New York Times on July 19 9. That Trump had a tense conversation with Australia's prime minister The denials Thank you to Prime Minister of Australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about. Very nice! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017 The confirmation \"Well the President takes these leaks very seriously. Cause if you think about it, they are happening in a secure setting between two world leaders, two heads of government.\u201d - Spicer later on Feb. 3 1 of 34 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Members of President Trump\u2019s administration: Moments that made headlines View Photos White House and Cabinet officials left strong impressions in the early days of the administration.
