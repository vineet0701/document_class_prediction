The leaks will make it harder for the US to carry out high-level diplomacy and resolve serious crises, not just under Trump but potentially far beyond his presidency.The publication of transcripts by the Washington Post is the latest of many signs that established norms are breaking down inside the administration, with far-reaching and unpredictable implications. Such documents should have been very closely held, accessible to only a few senior officials. Their publication reflects the intensity of the war inside the White House between rival factions \u2013 and a reminder that, for all his well-advertised toughness, the new chief of staff, John Kelly, is going to find it very hard to impose discipline on an institution that is dysfunctional from the top down.It is quite possible that the leaker was motivated by anxiety about the national security implications of Trump\u2019s erratic leadership \u2013 that the leak is a cry for help from inside the administration. The transcripts of his conversations with Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Malcolm Turnbull show the president to be no more coherent in private than he is public: ill-informed \u2013 even about a major attack on US soil \u2013 and narcissistic to the point of absurdity. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump tweets anger at \u2018dumb\u2019 Australia refugee deal\u201cI am the world\u2019s greatest person,\u201d he tells Turnbull, and boasts to his fellow world leaders about the size of the crowds who turn out to hear him speak. Maintaining his image as a strong leader in the eyes of his supporters emerges, again and again in the course of the conversations, as an overarching priority \u2013 over and above the maintenance of strong relations with allied countries.The transcripts serve as a reminder that being \u201cnice\u201d to Trump counts for more than long-term strategic alliances. At one point in his castigation of Turnbull, he compared him unfavourably with Vladimir Putin, with whom Trump had recently spoken. \u201cPutin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous,\u201d Trump said shortly before ending the call abruptly. In private as in public, Trump\u2019s praise for the Russian president is an unshakeable constant.White House leaks: transcripts show extent of Trump's inconsistencies Read more Perhaps the least surprising upshot of the release of the transcripts is the confirmation that the president and his administration deliberately misled the public about them. When the Washington Post published an account of the Turnbull conversation in early February, Trump tweeted that it had been a \u201cvery civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about\u201d. As has happened repeatedly over the course of the administration, the emergence of the facts has upheld the news reports, and shown the denials to be fake. Trump repeatedly tries to coach Pe\u00f1a Nieto on how to mislead the press, urging him to stop repeating Mexico\u2019s refusal to pay for Trump\u2019s proposed border wall. The wall and its supposed Mexican funding was a mainstay of Trump campaign speeches. In private, Trump tells the Mexican leader to stop reminding voters of a promise the new president cannot fulfil. He argues the wall and its financing is \u201cthe least important thing that we are talking about\u201d and says he is in a \u201cpolitical bind\u201d because he had \u201cbeen talking about it for a two-year period\u201d. Similar themes recur in the Turnbull conversation. Here, the divisive issue is an agreement that the Obama administration struck with Australia to consider accepting 1,250 refugees, mostly from Muslim countries, being detained by Australia on Pacific islands after trying to enter the country by boat. In return, Australia would host Latin American migrants. Trump is furious that abiding by the agreement could harm his image among his voters, just after he had signed his first abortive executive order cutting the acceptance of refugees from Syria and suspending travel from a list of seven mainly Muslim countries.\u201cThis is going to kill me. I am the world\u2019s greatest person that does not want to let people into the country,\u201d Trump says. \u201cIt makes me look so bad, and I have only been here a week.\u201dThe fact that the refugees in question are from Muslim countries is the key for Trump. \u201cI hate taking these people. I guarantee you they are bad,\u201d he said. Turnbull pleads with him to stick to the agreement for the sake of the bilateral relationship and in the end, Trump agrees he does not have much choice, but does so with little grace, aiming a personal slight at the Australian, saying he had \u201cbrokered many a stupid deal in business\u201d.For all Turnbull\u2019s attempts to smooth over their differences, Trump is clearly in a foul temper by the end of the discussion, and broader bilateral issues are shelved. When Turnbull asks to discuss Syria and North Korea \u2013 two global crises in which their two countries are strategic partners \u2013 Trump is not interested and ends the call.
