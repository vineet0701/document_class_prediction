McMaster said Susan Rice will keep her top-secret security clearance By Sara A. Carter Share0 Share0 August 03, 2017 01:40 PM EDT Almost one month after it was disclosed that former President Obama's National Security Adviser Susan Rice was unmasking members of President Trump\u2019s team and other Americans, Trump\u2019s own national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, sent an official letter giving her unfettered and continuing access to classified information and waiving her \u201cneed-to-know\u201d requirement on anything she viewed or received during her tenure, Circa has confirmed.The undated and unclassified letter from McMaster was sent in the mail to Rice's home during the last week of April. Trump was not aware of the letter or McMaster\u2019s decision, according to two senior West Wing officials and an intelligence official, who spoke to Circa on condition that they not be named. This is the letter from McMaster to Rice. Names, phone numbers and personal addresses have been blurred. \u201cI hereby waive the requirement that you must have a \u2018need-to-know\u2019 to access any classified information contained in items you 'originated, reviewed, signed or received while serving,' as National Security Adviser,\u201d the letter said. The letter also states that the \u201cNSC will continue to work with you to ensure the appropriate security clearance documentation remains on file to allow you access to classified information.\u201d Circa revealed in March that during President Obama\u2019s tenure, top aides -- including Rice, former CIA Director John Brennan and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch -- routinely reviewed intelligence reports received from the National Security Agency\u2019s incidental intercepts of Americans abroad. They were doing so by taking advantage of rules Obama relaxed starting in 2011 to help the government better fight terrorism, espionage by foreign enemies and hacking threats, according to documents obtained by Circa. In June, the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Rice as part of the committee\u2019s larger investigation into the unmasking of Americans under the Obama administration. Rice maintains that she never accessed the information inappropriately and has agreed to testify before the committee.Under the law, and under certain conditions, it is common practice for some senior government officials to be given the unfettered access to classified information, and their \u201cneed to know\u201d is waived under \"Executive Order 13526 Section 4.4 Access by Historical Researchers and Certain Former Government Personnel.\u201d But the White House officials told Circa that under the current congressional investigation, and given President Trump\u2019s ongoing concern that members of his team were unmasked, Rice\u2019s clearance should have been limited to congressional testimony only or revoked until the end of the investigation. Rice and Brennan have confirmed they sought the unredacted names of Americans in NSA-sourced intelligence reports, but insisted their requests were routine parts of their work and that they did nothing improper. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power also has legal authority to unmask officials.In a June tweet, Trump called the revelation that Rice and other Obama senior officials were unmasking members of his team the \u201cbig story\u2026 the \u2018unmasking and surveillance' that took place during the Obama administration.\u201d\u201cBasically, this letter which was signed in the last week of April undercuts the president\u2019s assertion that Susan Rice\u2019s unmasking activity was inappropriate. In essence, anybody who committed a violation as she did would not be given access to classified information,\u201d said a senior West Wing official, who was shown the document by Circa and verified its authenticity. \u201cIn fact, they would have their security clearance and right to 'need-to-know' stripped.\u201d Advertisement\u201cThe point is, is that it lowers the bar for her,\u201d the Senior West Wing official said.\u201cThis memo McMaster sent to Rice makes it so that she doesn\u2019t have to prove a continuing 'need-to-know' to have access to classified information and in effect is a White House pardon of Susan Rice and could be used by other Obama officials who conducted targeted unmasking of the campaign as a defense,\u201d the official added.The White House has not responded to requests for comment. An intelligence official told Circa \u201cthat the NSA decision to provide this level of access to the subject of several ongoing investigations and to waive her \u2018need-to-know\u2019 requirement raises serious legal, moral and ethical concerns.\u201dAccording to information obtained by Circa, dozens of times in 2016, those intelligence reports identified Americans who were directly intercepted talking to foreign sources or who were the subject of conversations between two or more monitored foreign figures. Sometimes Americans\u2019 names were officially unmasked; other times they were so specifically described in the reports that their identities were readily discernible. Among those cleared to request and consume unmasked NSA-based intelligence reports about U.S. citizens were Rice, his Brennan and Lynch. Shortly after Circa released the redacted documents disclosing the change in rules, it was revealed that Power had also extensively requested permission to unmask American names in incidental foreign intercepts.RELATED STORIES | Former Obama aide Ben Rhodes is now a person of interest in the unmasking investigationFBI lawyer allegedly under investigation for purportedly leaking about Yahoo, Inc. programAdvertisementEXCLUSIVE: A top FBI lawyer is allegedly under an investigation for leaking classified information to the mediaTagsNational SecurityNational IntelligenceWhite HouseDonald TrumpUnited States About the Author Sara A.
