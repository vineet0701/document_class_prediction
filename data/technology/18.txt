Titans of Silicon Valley have called for comprehensive immigration reform, including increases to high-skilled worker visas. The only problem is that the RAISE Act wouldn\u2019t actually accomplish any of this. What it would do, instead, is cut legal immigration in half, make it harder for families to stay together, and give radical anti-immigrant groups something to celebrate at their weekly happy hour.\u201cWe should make it easier for people to come here and contribute, not just eliminate the family-based immigration system and pretend that\u2019s a more merit-based system,\u201d says Todd Schulte, president of the bipartisan immigration lobbying firm FWD.us, which was founded by Mark Zuckerberg and other tech industry leaders, and has led the charge for immigration reform in the Valley.The DetailsThe RAISE Act, short for Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy Act, was introduced by Republican Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue, two congressmen who have competed for the title of Congress\u2019s most conservative senator since Jeff Sessions ceded it to become Attorney General. The bill eliminates the diversity visa program, which awards 50,000 visas every year based on a lottery. It cuts so-called \u201cchain immigration,\u201d in which immigrants can sponsor their family members to come to the United States. It caps the number of refugees admitted to the United States every year at 50,000. And it creates a point system in which visa applicants are scored based on \u201cpredictors of immigrant success,\u201d like their ability to speak English and their education level.It would be a chilly about-face for a nation that once promised to take in the world\u2019s cold, huddled masses. And while such a point system looks like it would benefit the tech industry by prioritizing high-skilled immigrants, it includes no provisions to actually expand the number of high-skilled visas that the tech industry has been clamoring for. What\u2019s more, it would force immigrants who do make the cut to kiss their families goodbye, which could lead more of them to choose to bypass the US in favor of Canada, as some skilled workers are already doing.To make the proposed point system more palatable, President Trump noted its similarity to programs in countries like Canada and Australia, which both use a similar vetting system. And yet, as Alex Nowrasteh of the conservative Cato Institute points out, those countries admit far more skilled immigrants as a percentage of their population than the United States does. In 2013, he writes, new immigrants accounted for .74 percent of Canada\u2019s population, 1.1 percent of Australia\u2019s, and just .31 percent of the United States\u2019 population.Canada has recently become something of a haven for tech entrepreneurs who have been shut out of the US. It's one of several countries creating new visa programs aimed at attracting more entrepreneurs and high-skilled workers.It's little wonder, then, that the RAISE Act is just the latest immigration proposal by the White House to receive pushback from the tech industry. According to PayPal cofounder Max Levchin, who came to the US as a refugee under political asylum, this bill and other aspects of the Trump administration's immigration agenda \"severely harm our economic growth and eliminate our greatest global economic competitive advantage: our ability to attract the best and the brightest.\"Questionable RootsWhile the RAISE Act bears little resemblance to the legislation the tech industry has been advocating for, it is essentially ripped from the homepages of groups like NumbersUSA and FAIR, short for the Federation of American Immigration Reform, which the Southern Poverty Law Center classifies as a hate group. According to the SPLC, these organizations are the progeny of a man named John Tanton, an anti-immigrant crusader who has, since the 1980s, funded organizations focused on population control. Tanton has advocated in the past for \u201cpassive eugenics\u201d and argued that Adolf Hitler besmirched eugenics\u2019 good name.Tanton founded FAIR and reportedly funded the creation of NumbersUSA, which was officially founded by Tanton\u2019s close associate Roy Beck. (NumbersUSA denies any ideological connection to Tanton, but declined to comment on whether Tanton had funded the organization.) The RAISE Act is a carbon copy of the policies both FAIR and NumbersUSA have promoted for years, from the elimination of the diversity lottery to the refugee cap to the gutting of \u201cchain migration.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been rallying trying to get immigration reform that incorporates those principles,\u201d says Eric Ruark, director of research at NumbersUSA. \"Having the White House behind it is a big push.\"An English language proficiency requirement is among the many policies Tanton advocated for through another one of this organizations, ProEnglish. And the think tank he created, Center for Immigration Studies, is the one that produced the study President Trump cited Wednesday, claiming that more than 50 percent of households headed by an immigrant are on welfare. Conservative analysts, including Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute, have challenged that finding, arguing that because it studies households, not individuals, it doesn\u2019t account for the number of native-born people living within that household, which can artificially exaggerate the numbers. Meanwhile, as it stands today, immigrants are barred from receiving welfare assistance for their first five years in the United States.As today\u2019s White House ceremony shows, these once fringe ideas have now made it into the political mainstream and are being snuck into legislation under the guise of promoting skilled labor. The good news is that, while the White House may support this bill, it\u2019s unlikely many senators will. \u201cI think it\u2019s dead on arrival,\u201d Nowrasteh says. \u201cA lot of Republican senators like legal immigration. They think it\u2019s good for the economy. They think family unification is great. They\u2019re just against illegal immigration.\u201dIn his remarks Wednesday, President Trump framed the RAISE Act as a bid to protect American workers and create good-paying jobs in America. And yet 40 percent of Fortune 500 businesses were started by immigrants and their children, \"many of whom did not speak English or came here as refugees,\" says AOL cofounder Steve Case. \"For more than two centuries, we were viewed as a nation of opportunity for all, and I believe that this act not only fails to recognize the economic and social benefits of immigrants but could repel the very talent we want to attract.\u201dThe RAISE Act, in other words, would likely end up creating lots of good-paying jobs\u2014somewhere else.#Trump#immigration#technologyMost PopulargearHow to Make Your Wi-Fi Faster and BetterAuthor: David PierceDavid PiercecultureIs 'The Dark Tower' Any Good?
