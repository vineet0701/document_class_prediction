A new business concept could let Earth-bound gamers play with nanobots on the lunar surface. Sci-Techby Amanda Kooser3 August 2017 10:42 am AEST @akooser Enlarge ImageThis nanobot concept could take gaming all the way to the moon. Lunatix If the European Space Agency has its way, gaming is going to be out of this world.\u00a0Lunatix, a company created by a team of space engineers, developed a camera-equipped, jumping nanobot that would be used in augmented reality scenarios on the moon. Gamers would control the robots from Earth, though they'd experience slight delays as the signals travel to the moon and back.\u00a0The Lunatix nanobots concept came about through the ESA's SpaceTech 2016 program, which called on participants to design profitable space businesses. The nanobots would be a key part of a augmented-reality game that would generate revenue through monthly subscriptions. The Lunatix team's plan is to first develop a game using virtual nanobots in a simulated moon environment to boost interest before deploying the actual hardware.\"After raising initial enthusiasm among Earth's 1.8 billion gamers with controlling a virtual Nanobot on a simulated lunar surface, there will be the possibility to control real Nanobots. on the Moon, in Pokemon Go!-style augmented reality scenarios,\" the ESA said on Wednesday.\u00a0More ESAHere's how we might save fallen astronauts on the moonSimulated Mars dust makes for weird 3D-printed objectsCozy up to 60,000 stars with ESA's dazzling interactive Star Mapper If the nanobots are sent to the moon, they'd be based in a rover that would shelter and charge them over the long lunar night. They'd also take advantage of the moon's low gravity to jump as high as 10 feet (3 meters) and as far as 33 feet (10 meters).\u00a0Communicating with the nanobots will involve a delay of roughly 3 seconds, according to Jon Reijneveld, an Airbus Defence and Space system engineer who contributed to the project.The Lunatix team expects development and deployment of the nanobots would take about four years. The finalized game would use real images and video from the moon. Some \"exclusive users\" would be able to buy an option that would allow them to control their own nanobot, according to a\u00a0business plan.\u00a0Lunatix is at the beginning stage of the project so It's hard to know if the gaming nanobots will become reality. Still, it's an intriguing concept. The team is already imagining a world beyond the moon, writing, \"Once the validity of the business proposal has been demonstrated on the Moon, LUNATIX's next stop could be Mars!\"\u00a0That's an admirable ambition.\u00a0 Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.Batteries Not Included: The CNET team reminds us why tech is cool.10 Space cheese and 9 other weird items we've sent into orbit (pictures)Share your voice0TagsSci-TechGamingPokemon GoAugmented realitySpace More storiesGrab this prime solar eclipse viewing spot for just $80,000Elon Musk may build Hyperloop himself, startups be damnedNext NASA New Horizons target might be really weird-lookingWelcome the Boneyard, a desert tomb for US military aircraft CloseDiscuss: Lunar nanobots could bring AR gaming to the...GuidelinesLog InPlease log in to CNET to commentPost Comment As...
