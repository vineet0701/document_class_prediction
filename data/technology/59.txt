The government has twice had its plans to tackle the issue ruled illegal by the courts.The tunnel plans are outlined in an air improvement strategy plan to help reduce pollution. Officials say they are investing millions of pounds in new technology to improve air quality around roads in the next five years. The Department of Transport predicts traffic volumes are expected to increase by 55% between 2010 and 2040.

In the meantime we are investing \u00a3100m to test new ideas including less-polluting fuels and road barriers which can absorb harmful emissions,\u201d said an agency spokesman.\u2018\u2018We have identified that a cantilever barrier or canopy, which is a tunnel-like structure designed to prevent vehicle emissions, might be a possible solution, though the air quality benefits of this are still to be fully understood. We are now working with the Dutch Roads Authority to measure air quality around an existing cantilever barrier on their network.\u2019\u2019Highways officials said they have also trialled two different types of barriers. The first, featuring wood panels 4 metres and 6 metres high, were fitted to the M62 near junction 18 in Manchester. A second trial, which is ongoing, features a 3 metre high fence coated in a mineral polymer material capable of absorbing nitrogen dioxide. \u201cThe results from the monitoring of this trial will help us understand if this has been a success with the potential to implement it on the rest of our network,\u201d said a Highways Agency spokesman.A Highways England spokesman said on Wednesday they were also carrying out emission testing from a range of diesel vehicles using a new type of fuel believed to help improve emissions on both motorways and urban driving. To help boost electric car use they will aim to ensure that 95% of the roads network will have a vehicle charging point every 20 miles.TopicsUK newsMotoringnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on Messenger View on theguardian.com{{#showContent}}{{displayName}}{{#description}}{{description}}{{/description}}{{#content}}{{#headline}}{{#isVideo}}{{/isVideo}}{{#isGallery}}{{/isGallery}}{{#isAudio}}{{/isAudio}}{{#isComment}}{{/isComment}}{{headline}}{{#isComment}}{{byline}}{{/isComment}}{{#showWebPublicationDate}}Published: {{webPublicationDate}}{{/showWebPublicationDate}}{{headline}}{{/headline}}{{/content}}{{/showContent}}More storiesMore stories{{#showContent}}{{displayName}}{{#description}}{{description}}{{/description}}{{#content}}{{#headline}}{{#isVideo}}{{/isVideo}}{{#isGallery}}{{/isGallery}}{{#isAudio}}{{/isAudio}}{{#isComment}}{{/isComment}}{{headline}}{{#isComment}}{{byline}}{{/isComment}}{{#showWebPublicationDate}}Published: {{webPublicationDate}}{{/showWebPublicationDate}}{{headline}}{{/headline}}{{/content}}{{/showContent}}More stories{{#showContent}}{{displayName}}{{#description}}{{description}}{{/description}}{{#content}}{{#headline}}{{#isVideo}}{{/isVideo}}{{#isGallery}}{{/isGallery}}{{#isAudio}}{{/isAudio}}{{#isComment}}{{/isComment}}{{headline}}{{#isComment}}{{byline}}{{/isComment}}{{#showWebPublicationDate}}Published: {{webPublicationDate}}{{/showWebPublicationDate}}{{headline}}{{/headline}}{{/content}}{{/showContent}}More stories{{#showContent}}{{displayName}}{{#description}}{{description}}{{/description}}{{#content}}{{#headline}}{{#isVideo}}{{/isVideo}}{{#isGallery}}{{/isGallery}}{{#isAudio}}{{/isAudio}}{{#isComment}}{{/isComment}}{{headline}}{{#isComment}}{{byline}}{{/isComment}}{{#showWebPublicationDate}}Published: {{webPublicationDate}}{{/showWebPublicationDate}}{{headline}}{{/headline}}{{/content}}{{/showContent}}More storiesback to topbecome a supportermake a contributionsecuredropsolve technical issueadvertise with uswork for uscontact uscomplaints & correctionsterms & conditionsprivacy policycookie policydigital newspaper archiveall topicsall contributorsFacebookTwitter\u00a9 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
