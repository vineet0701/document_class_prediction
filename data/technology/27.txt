By Tom Randall @tsrandallMore stories by Tom RandallAugust 2, 2017, 5:35 PM EDT From Tesla's Solar Roof Is Cheaper Than ExpectedFirst the Model 3 electric car. Now the solar roof. In just one week, Tesla has challenged two distinct industries with radically new products.\u00a0 The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Tesla has completed its first solar roof installations, the company reported Wednesday as part of a second-quarter earnings report. Just like the first Model 3 customers, who took their keys last week, the first solar roof customers are Tesla employees. By selling to them first, Tesla says it hopes to work out any kinks in\u00a0the sales and installation process before taking it to a wider public audience.\u201cI have them on my house, JB has them on his house,\u201d\u00a0Musk said, referring to Tesla\u2019s Chief Technology Officer\u00a0J.B.\u00a0Straubel. \u201cThis is version one. I think this roof is going to look really knock-out as we just keep iterating.\u201d\u00a0One of the first completed installations of a Tesla Solar Roof.\u00a0TeslaTesla\u00a0opened up its online store\u00a0in May and began taking $1,000 deposits for smooth\u00a0black and textured-glass roof tiles that are virtually indistinguishable\u00a0from high-end roofing.\u00a0From most viewing angles, the slick modern shingles look like standard materials, but they allow light to pass through onto a solar cell embedded beneath a tempered surface. The first installations were supposed to start in June. Tesla didn\u2019t say when the actual installations took place.The company has been\u00a0adopting\u00a0an\u00a0Apple Store strategy for solar power\u00a0since\u00a0acquiring SolarCity Corp. last year for $2 billion. The idea is to cut down on the high price\u00a0associated with\u00a0actively identifying\u00a0new customers, and instead\u00a0attract them passively through its upscale auto stores in shopping malls and other high-traffic locations.\u00a0Initial trials\u00a0found\u00a0the new approach\u00a0was 50 to 100 percent more effective than at the best non-Tesla locations selling SolarCity products. Tesla halted SolarCity\u2019s door-to-door sales earlier this year and is staffing up more than 70 stores for solar sales.Can you tell which shingles have solar cells?\u00a0TeslaFor total quarterly solar installations, Tesla rebounded a bit from an underwhelming first quarter\u2014its first full quarter after it bought SolarCity. It deployed 176 megawatts, up from 150 megawatts\u00a0the prior quarter, but less than\u00a0the 201 megawatts that SolarCity installed in the second quarter of 2016. At least part of the slowdown may be\u00a0due to the cessation of door-to-door sales. The company said it expects to see growth again in the fourth quarter.\u00a0Production of the tiles began\u00a0at Tesla\u2019s\u00a0Fremont solar\u00a0plant in California, but will shift later this year\u00a0to its\u00a0new factory in Buffalo, New York, with additional investments from Tesla\u2019s\u00a0partner, Panasonic. Musk said previously that initial sales will be limited by manufacturing capacity. As production ramps up into 2018, sales will begin in the U.K., Australia, and elsewhere, along with the introduction of additional sculpted terra cotta and slate versions of the solar roof, according to previous reports from the company.\u00a0BloombergTesla\u2019s basic premise is to make solar ownership more attractive and affordable by eliminating\u00a0the need to install both a roof\u00a0and\u00a0solar panels. Tesla says it will manage the entire process of solar roof installation, including removal of existing roofs, design, permits, installation, and maintenance. The company estimates that each installation will take about a week.Read Next:\u00a0Driving Tesla\u2019s Model 3 Changes EverythingTesla\u00a0\u2014 With assistance by Brian EckhouseBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.LEARN MOREMost ReadApple Plans to Release a Cellular-Capable Watch to Break iPhone TiesFord\u2019s Mustang Has a Problem: The New MustangWhy \u2018Pharma Bro\u2019 Martin Shkreli Is Swaggering Into JailShkreli Decries \u2018Witch Hunt\u2019 After Being Convicted of Securities FraudThe Pretty European Nation That\u2019s Becoming a Dining Hotspot Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy \u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.
