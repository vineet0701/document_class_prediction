By Eric Roston @erostonMore stories by Eric RostonAugust 1, 2017, 1:22 PM EDT From Construction on the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station near Jenkinsville, S.C. on Sept. 21, 2016.Photographer: Chuck Burton/AP PhotoScana Corp. announced Monday it will stop construction on a nuclear power plant\u00a0in South Carolina\u2014one of two in development in the U.S. Project costs ballooned in recent years, and the decision should eventually save electricity customers $7 billion.\u00a0But the stoppage and others like it\u00a0may cost everyone more in the long run. The move has implications that last hundreds of years\u2014the residence time of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere\u2014as electricity generated from fossil fuels begin to replace aging or expensive nuclear reactors.\u00a0Nuclear power has long provoked ardent policy fights, historically\u00a0centered on the perceived safety or danger of splitting atoms to keep consumers\u2019\u00a0refrigerators running. Since America\u2019s most famous close-call\u2014the 1979 partial reactor meltdown at Three Mile Island\u2014debates have only grown in complexity.Today, it\u2019s not local or environmental opposition but economics that\u2019s crippling\u00a0industry growth and undercutting the fiscal viability of existing plants. A natural gas installation coming online in 2022 might cost $14 a megawatt-hour in apples-to-apples capital costs, according to the Energy Information Administration\u2019s 2017 Annual Energy Outlook. Nuclear plants would need more than $70/MWh. (The latest EIA outlook doesn\u2019t project coal costs because under Obama-era regulations, none were expected to be built.)Low natural gas prices are undercutting even the relatively cheap\u00a0costs of operating many online U.S. nuclear plants, making some of them too expensive to run.\u00a0Among those existing reactors, Three-Mile Island is the latest victim of the U.S. shale gas boom, and to some extent, reduced demand and increased renewables. It\u2019s now expected to close in 2019. Four states that have shuttered nuclear facilities in recent years have turned to gas and\u00a0coal to make up the difference.\u00a0Energy Information AdministrationMore gas and coal, of course, means more emitted carbon dioxide. And that\u2019s exactly what scientists say we need to reduce in order to slow climate change, or at the very least avoid global environmental catastrophe.\u00a0But renewable energies like solar and wind aren\u2019t enough to replace fossil fuels, at least not yet. This is where nuclear comes in. It may be very difficult to meet international carbon-cutting goals without widespread addition of nuclear plants. The Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project is an international research effort into\u00a0how leading polluters\u2019 may need to transform their energy systems to cut carbon below levels identified as safe by scientists. The U.S. analysis, which was conducted by the consultancy Energy and Environmental Economics\u00a0Inc. and two national laboratories, found that electricity demand might double by 2050\u2014while the amount of CO2 emitted per dollar of GDP would need to fall to between 3 percent and 10 percent of current levels. The report lays out three main scenarios that would achieve such dramatic reductions.A\u00a0renewables scenario, which calls for about 30 times 2015 capacity.The coal scenario, which would require roughly doubling current coal-generated power (provided it has\u00a0carbon-capture and storage technology that\u00a0doesn\u2019t exist).\u00a0The \u201chigh-nuclear\u201d scenario.This third option\u00a0calls for a quadrupling of 2015 U.S. nuclear power production. And with Scana nixing 2.2 gigawatts of construction, Three-Mile Island\u2019s announced closure, and the generally weak state of the industry, the U.S. isn\u2019t showing much capacity to even hold\u00a0the line.\u00a0\u201cWithout an aggressive build-out of nuclear power, climate goals are still attainable, but at much greater expense,\u201d according to Jeffrey Sachs, the economist and director\u00a0of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, which co-leads the Deep Decarbonization\u00a0effort. \u201cThe rest of the options are still feasible, but less attractive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d make a big mistake if we decide right now we don\u2019t need it.\u201dThe V.C. Summer Nuclear Station near Jenkinsville, South Carolina.Photographer: Chuck Burton/APAsked how to overcome the unfavorable economics that killed the South Carolina project and is shuttering active plants, Sachs suggested a rethinking of the entire nuclear research, development, and deployment pipeline. Newer technologies\u2014some being pursued in other countries\u2014may dramatically reduce costs, if they prove safe.\u00a0A magic wand solving the cost problems would still leave the problem of waste, and give policymakers a choice between nuclear waste\u2014deadly but concentrated poison that lasts thousands of years\u2014and fossil-fuel waste\u2014invisible, diffuse carbon pollution that in sufficient amounts will transform the Earth for thousands of years.\u00a0 The most important business stories of the day.

While nuclear waste is nasty stuff, so are the conventional\u00a0pollutants of fossil-fuel burning. The Brattle Group has previously found that \u201cnuclear power avoids air emissions of over one million tons of sulfur dioxide and 650,000 tons of nitrogen oxides each year, as well as significant particulate emissions.\u201d Restricting these toxins saves America more than $9 billion a year.Emissions cuts made today are worth more than the same cuts made down the road, authors of a Brattle Group report wrote in December. \u201cSince CO2 emissions persist for many years in the atmosphere,\u201d they said, \u201cnear-term emission reductions are more helpful for climate protection than later ones.\u201dBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.LEARN MOREMost ReadApple Plans to Release a Cellular-Capable Watch to Break iPhone TiesFord\u2019s Mustang Has a Problem: The New MustangWhy \u2018Pharma Bro\u2019 Martin Shkreli Is Swaggering Into JailShkreli Decries \u2018Witch Hunt\u2019 After Being Convicted of Securities FraudThe Pretty European Nation That\u2019s Becoming a Dining Hotspot Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy \u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.
