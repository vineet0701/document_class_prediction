Research and development funding in Asia has exploded, particularly in China and South Korea.Asia is now by far the world\u2019s top spender on\u00a0research and development, spending 42% of all global\u00a0research and development funding in 2013, a staggering $700 billion dollars a year and growing rapidly.Global R&D expenditures by region 2013North America has fallen to second place in\u00a0research and development funding, spending 29% of the total.In contrast to China, funding growth in the United States and the EU has slowed to a trickle. The US\u00a0research and development funding growth has collapsed from average of 5%+ annually from 1998-2003 to less than 2.5% between 2008-2013, while China\u2019s annual growth in funding comes in at a blistering 18% between 2008-2013.Average annual growth in gross domestic expenditures on R&D for the United States, EU, andselected other countries: 1998\u20132013This rapid funding increase enabled China to reach parity with US in science and engineering article output in 2013.China is now also matching the US in the size of its value added high technology industry, with both countries coming in at around $500 billion.Value added of HT manufacturing industries for selected regions/countries/economies: 1999\u20132014China has also made significant gains in the quality of its research output, which has often been maligned for being derivative, copied and uninnovative.China\u2019s output of high quality research matched that of Japan in 2012 and its research quality (measured by the ratio of top 1% most cited papers) roughly doubled between 2001 and 2012, from 0.4% to 0.8%. The research quality scores in US and Japan are 1.9% and 0.8%, respectively.This year, China dominated the artificial intelligence ImageNet competition, with more than half of the participating teams coming from China. A Beijing-based team won first place with a world record\u00a02.25% error rate, human performance is estimate at around 5%. China\u2019s government also released plans this year to match the US in AI by 2020.If current trends continue unabated, China will almost certainly surpass the US in high quality research output by the end of the next decade.Facebook CommentsTAGSaiartificial intelligencechinaR&Dresearch and developmentSuperpowerUS SHAREFacebookTwittertweet Previous articleNew Video of Boston Dynamics\u2019 SpotMini RobotNext articleDeepMind Co-founder Mustafa Suleyman \u2013 AI Can Make The World a Fairer, Greener and Healthier Place Neal RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR AMD Has Built the First PetaFLOPS Computer That Fits in a Single Server Rack Elon Musk Raised The Risk of AI Again in Today\u2019s Tesla Conference Call India\u2019s Government Wants to Ban Self-Driving Cars to Save Jobs Facebook1,801FollowersFollow Recent Posts AMD Has Built the First PetaFLOPS Computer That Fits in a Single Server RackElon Musk Raised The Risk of AI Again in Today\u2019s Tesla Conference CallIndia\u2019s Government Wants to Ban Self-Driving Cars to Save JobsDeepMind Co-founder Mustafa Suleyman \u2013 AI Can Make The World a Fairer, Greener and Healthier PlaceData Shows China\u2019s Stunning Rise in Science and Technology Research PollWhat is the most likely date for the technological singularity? 2030 2045 2075 2100+View Results\u00a0Loading ...
