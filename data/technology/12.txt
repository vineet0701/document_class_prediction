But it isn\u2019t likely to happen, and it wouldn\u2019t help Sprint at all.Nikkei reported earlier this week that Sprint parent SoftBank was considering pursuing a merger between Dish, which has stated its intentions to leverage its spectrum holdings by building an NB-IoT network, and the U.S. carrier. That report is just the latest in a series of rumored deals that have Sprint tying up in some form with T-Mobile, Charter, Comcast or a combination of those three companies.A marriage with Sprint makes some sense for Dish, which continues to see both its subscriber base and total service revenues wane. It does nothing to help Sprint, though, which controls an impressive portfolio of 2.5 GHz spectrum but faces serious financial challenges as it gradually deploys service on those airwaves.\u201cPerhaps reports that SoftBank is considering an acquisition of Dish Network are true \u2026 but we sort of doubt it,\u201d Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson wrote in a note to investors this morning. \u201cTo be sure, given Dish\u2019s rapidly deteriorating financial position, we can understand why Dish would be interested. And a deal with Sprint would actually have strategic merit for Dish, which would secure infrastructure that would help reduce the cost of deploying its spectrum.\u201cUnfortunately, Dish would bring no benefit to Sprint whatsoever\u2014Sprint already has more spectrum than it knows what to do with, and Dish\u2019s rapidly declining EBITDA would hurt Sprint\u2019s liquidity position more than it would help.\u201dThat isn\u2019t to say that both companies don\u2019t need help in the wireless market, of course. Dish faces a significant challenge in building an IoT-focused network from the ground up, and the company has no experience in wireless. And Sprint needs a cash infusion to help it continue to narrow the network gap with its bigger rivals as U.S. carriers prepare to roll out 5G services.But the economics of an arrangement between Dish and Sprint appear to be unworkable, Moffett said.\u201cAnd here\u2019s the bigger problem: both companies\u2019 stock prices discount a high probability of being acquired \u2026 but not of being an acquirer,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMerging the two, with no meaningful synergies and no infusion of cash, would create a rapidly shrinking combined company with a warranted valuation far lower than the sum of their current market caps.\u201dRead more onmergers and acquisitions, Sprint, Dish Network, Craig Moffett, MoffettNathanson Popular ContentT-Mobile tops OpenSignal's latest network study while unlimited weighs on Verizon, AT&T Aug 02, 2017 John Donovan officially named CEO of AT&T Communications ahead of Time Warner acquisition Jul 31, 2017 AT&T's Lurie to step down next month Aug 02, 2017 Senators\u2019 proposal gets wide praise for making more spectrum available for commercial use Aug 02, 2017 Verizon, Qualcomm, Ericsson hit 953 Mbps with commercial LAA system in Florida Aug 02, 2017 About the Author Colin GibbsEditorcgibbs@fiercemarkets.comhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/fiercewireless\u200b Home Subscribe Manage Newsletter Subscriptions Advertise RSS Privacy Our Team Contact\u00a9 2017 Questex LLC.
