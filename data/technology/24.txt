No one knows why.

Beyond its rusted bars is a collection of radio towers, abandoned buildings and power lines bordered by a dry-stone wall. This sinister location is the focus of a mystery which stretches back to the height of the Cold War.It is thought to be the headquarters of a radio station, \u201cMDZhB\u201d, that no-one has ever claimed to run. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, for the last three-and-a-half decades, it\u2019s been broadcasting a dull, monotonous tone. Every few seconds it\u2019s joined by a second sound, like some ghostly ship sounding its foghorn. Then the drone continues.Once or twice a week, a man or woman will read out some words in Russian, such as \u201cdinghy\u201d or \u201cfarming specialist\u201d. And that\u2019s it. Anyone, anywhere in the world can listen in, simply by tuning a radio to the frequency 4625 kHz.It\u2019s so enigmatic, it\u2019s as if it was designed with conspiracy theorists in mind. Today the station has an online following numbering in the tens of thousands, who know it affectionately as \u201cthe Buzzer\u201d. It joins two similar mystery stations, \u201cthe Pip\u201d and the \u201cSqueaky Wheel\u201d. As their fans readily admit themselves, they have absolutely no idea what they are listening to. View image of Soviet radio (Credit: iStock) In fact, no-one does. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no information in the signal,\u201d says David Stupples, an expert in signals intelligence from City University, London.What\u2019s going on?The frequency is thought to belong to the Russian military, though they\u2019ve never actually admitted this. It first began broadcasting at the close of the Cold War, when communism was in decline. Today it\u2019s transmitted from two locations \u2013 the St Petersburg site and a location near Moscow. Bizarrely, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, rather than shutting down, the station\u2019s activity sharply increased.There\u2019s no shortage of theories to explain what the Buzzer might be for \u2013 ranging from keeping in touch with submarines to communing with aliens. One such idea is that it\u2019s acting as a \u201cDead Hand\u201d signal; in the event Russia is hit by a nuclear attack, the drone will stop and automatically trigger a retaliation. No questions asked, just total nuclear obliteration on both sides. There are clues in the signal itself This may not be as wacky as it sounds. The system was originally pioneered in the Soviet era, where it took the form of a computer system which scanned the airwaves for signs of life or nuclear fallout. Alarmingly, many experts believe it may still be in use. As Russian president Vladimir Putin pointed out himself earlier this year, \u201cnobody would survive\u201d a nuclear war between Russia and the United States. Could the Buzzer be warding one off?As it happens, there are clues in the signal itself. Like all international radio, the Buzzer operates at a relatively low frequency known as \u201cshortwave\u201d. This means that \u2013 compared to local radio, mobile phone and television signals \u2013 fewer waves pass through a single point every second. It also means they can travel a lot further.While you\u2019d be hard pressed to listen to a local station such as BBC Radio London in a neighbouring county, shortwave stations like the BBC World Service are aimed at audiences from Senegal to Singapore. Both stations are broadcast from the same building. View image of Nuclear weapon test at Bikini Atoll (Credit: Public Domain/ US DoD) It\u2019s all thanks to \u201cskywaves\u201d. Higher frequency radio signals can only travel in a straight line, eventually becoming lost as they bump into obstacles or reach the horizon. But shortwave frequencies have an extra trick \u2013 they can bounce off charged particles in the upper atmosphere, allowing them to zig-zag between the earth and the sky and travel thousands, rather than tens, of miles.Which brings us back to the Dead Hand theory. As you might expect, shortwave signals have proved extremely popular. Today they\u2019re used by ships, aircraft and the military to send messages across continents, oceans and mountain ranges. But there\u2019s a catch.The lofty layer isn\u2019t so much a flat mirror, but a wave, which undulates like the surface of the ocean. During the day it moves steadily higher, while at night, it creeps down towards the Earth. If you want to absolutely guarantee that your station can be heard on the other side of the planet \u2013 and if you\u2019re using it as a cue for nuclear war, you probably do \u2013 it\u2019s important to change the frequency depending on the time of day, to catch up. The BBC World Service already does this. The Buzzer doesn\u2019t.Another idea is that the radio station exists to \u201csound\u201d out how far away the layer of charged particles is. \u201cTo get good results from the radar systems the Russians use to spot missiles, you need to know this,\u201d says Stupples. The longer the signal takes to get up into the sky and down again, the higher it must be. There is a station with some striking similarities Alas, that can\u2019t be it either. To analyse the layer\u2019s altitude the signal would usually have a certain sound, like a car alarm going off \u2013 the result of varying the waves to get them just right. \u201cThey sound nothing like the Buzzer,\u201d says Stupples.\u00a0Intriguingly, there is a station with some striking similarities. The \u201cLincolnshire Poacher\u201d ran from the mid-1970s to 2008. Just like the Buzzer, it could be heard on the other side of the planet. Just like the Buzzer, it emanated from an undisclosed location, thought to be somewhere in Cyprus. And just like the Buzzer, its transmissions were just plain creepy.At the beginning of every hour, the station would play the first two bars of an English folk tune, the Lincolnshire Poacher.\u201cOh \u2018tis my delight on a shining night In the season of the yearWhen I was bound apprentice in famous Lincolnshire\u2018Twas well I served my master for nigh on seven years\u2026\u201dAfter repeating this12 times, it would move on to messages read by the disembodied voice of a woman reading groups of five numbers \u2013 \u201c1-2-0-3-6\u201d \u2013 in a clipped, upper-class English accent.To get to grips with what was going on, it helps to go back to the 1920s. The All-Russian Co-operative Society (Arcos) was an important trade body, responsible for overseeing transactions between the UK and the early Soviet Union. Or at least, that\u2019s what they said they did. View image of Police raiding the Arcos office (Credit: Getty) In May 1927, years after a British secret agent caught an employee sneaking into a communist news office in London, police officers stormed the Arcos building. The basement had been rigged with anti-intruder devices and they discovered a secret room with no door handle, in which workers were hurriedly burning documents.It may have been dramatic, but the British didn\u2019t discover anything that they didn\u2019t already know. Instead the raid was a wake-up call to the Soviets, who discovered that MI5 had been listening in on them for years.\u201cThis was a blunder of the very first order,\u201d says Anthony Glees, who directs the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham. To justify the raid, the prime minister had even read out some of the deciphered telegrams in the House of Commons.The upshot was that the Russians completely reinvented the way messages are encrypted. Almost overnight, they switched to \u201cone-time pads\u201d. In this system, a random key is generated by the person sending the message and shared only with the person receiving it. As long as the key really is perfectly random, the code cannot be cracked. There was no longer any need to worry about who could hear their messages.Enter the \u201cnumbers stations\u201d \u2013 radio stations that broadcast coded messages to spies all over the world. Soon even the British were doing it: if you can\u2019t beat them, join \u2018em, as they say. It\u2019s quite difficult to generate a completely random number because a system for doing so will, by its very nature, be predictable \u2013 exactly what you\u2019re trying to avoid. Instead officers in London found an ingenious solution.They\u2019d hang a microphone out of the window on Oxford Street and record the traffic. \u201cThere might be a bus beeping at the same time as a policeman shouting. The sound is unique, it will never happen again,\u201d says Stupples. Then they\u2019d convert this into a random code.Of course, that didn\u2019t stop people trying to break them. During World War Two, the British realised that they could, in fact, decipher the messages \u2013 but they\u2019d have to get their hands on the one-time pad that was used to encrypt them. \u201cWe discovered that the Russians used the out-of-date sheets of one-time pads as substitute toilet paper in Russian army hospitals in East Germany,\u201d says Glees. Needless to say, British intelligence officers soon found themselves rifling through the contents of Soviet latrines. Now North Korea are getting in on the act, too The new channel of communication was so useful, it didn\u2019t take long before the numbers stations had popped up all over the world. There was the colourfully named \u201cNancy Adam Susan\u201d, \u201cRussian Counting Man\u201d and \u201cCherry Ripe\u201d \u2013 the Lincolnshire Poacher\u2019s sister station, which also contained bars of an English folk song. In name at least, the Buzzer fits right in.It also fits with a series of arrests across the United States back in 2010. The FBI announced that it had broken up a \u201clong term, deep cover\u201d network of Russian agents, who were said to have received their instructions via coded messages on shortwave radio \u2013 specifically 7887 kHz.

On 14 April 2017, the broadcaster at Radio Pyongyang began: \u201cI\u2019m giving review works in elementary information technology lessons of the remote education university for No 27 expedition agents.\u201d This ill-concealed military message was followed by a series of page numbers \u2013 No 69 on page 823, page 957 \u2013 which look a lot like code.It may come as a surprise that numbers stations are still in use \u2013 but they hold one major advantage. Though it\u2019s possible to guess who is broadcasting, anyone can listen to the messages \u2013 so you don\u2019t know who they are being sent to. Mobile phones and the internet may be quicker, but open a text or email from a known intelligence agency and you could be rumbled. It only becomes a numbers station in moments of crisis, such as if Russia were invaded It\u2019s a compelling idea: the Buzzer has been hiding in plain sight, instructing a network of illicit Russian spies all over the world. There\u2019s just one problem. The Buzzer never broadcasts any numbered messages.This doesn\u2019t strictly matter, since one-time pads can be used to translate anything \u2013 from code words to garbled speech. \u201cIf this phone call was encrypted you\u2019d hear \u201c\u2026enejekdhejenw\u2026\u2019 but then it would come out the other side sounding like normal speech,\u201d says Stupples. But this would leave traces in the signal.To send information over the radio, essentially all you\u2019re doing is varying the height or spacing of the waves being transmitted. For example, two low waves in a row means x, or three waves closer together means y. When a signal is carrying information, instead of neat, evenly spaced waves like ripples on the ocean, you\u2019re left with a wave like the jagged silhouette of an ECG.

The constant drone is just a marker, saying \u201cthis frequency is mine, this frequency is mine\u2026\u201d to stop people from using it.It only becomes a numbers station in moments of crisis, such as if Russia were invaded. Then it would function as a way to instruct their worldwide spy network and military forces on standby in remote areas. After all, this is a country around 70 times the size of the UK.It seems they\u2019re already been practicing. \u201cIn 2013 they issued a special message, \u2018COMMAND 135 ISSUED\u2019 that was said to be test message for\u00a0full combat readiness,\u201d says M\u0101ris Goldmanis, a radio enthusiast who listens to the station from his home in the Baltic states.The mystery of the Russian radio may have been solved. But if its fans are right, let\u2019s just hope that drone never stops. \u00a0--Join 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0Twitter.If you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.
