The top 20 countries for Wi-Fi are mostly in Europe, with Lithuania and Croatia leading the pack with the fastest download speeds.Paste this Image on Your Site!Simply copy and paste the code below and you can share this infographic on your site:<a href=\"https://www.ooma.com/blog/best-worst-wifi-countries/\"><img alt=\"Best and Worst Countries for Wi-Fi Access\" src=\"https://www.ooma.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/best-worst-wifi-countries_IG.png\" width=\"600px\" height=\"5213px\" /></a><br><a href=\"https://www.ooma.com/blog/best-worst-wifi-countries/\">Best and Worst Countries for Wi-Fi Access</a> Created By: <a href=\"https://www.ooma.com/\"> Ooma.com</a>\u00a0Here are the top 20 countries for Wi-Fi and their connection speeds.

That\u2019s 888% growth since 2013. But these hotspots are not distributed equally.Below are the number of people per hotspot in each country.France: 2.8Belgium: 2.9Denmark: 4.3Austria: 4.6South Korea: 5.6U.S.: 5.8Switzerland: 6.0U.K.: 6.6Israel: 6.6Sweden: 9.4Japan: 9.5Germany: 9.6Australia: 10.7Poland: 11.4Norway: 12.4Spain: 13.0Canada: 13.5Argentina: 21.5United Arab Emirates: 40.2Brazil: 50.2Malaysia: 65.0China: 82.0Turkey: 84.5Mexico: 85.1Russia:88.0South Africa: 233.0Singapore: 320.2Thailand: 325.1Indonesia: 364.1Italy: 979.2Nigeria: 19,874.1India: 39,723.3Colombia: 214,523.1Average Connection Speeds by CountryIncluding residential and commercial access, the global average connection speed is 6.1 Mbps (megabits per second). The fastest connection speeds are in South Korea, Norway, Hong Kong, Sweden and Switzerland. The slowest connection speeds are in Venezuela, Paraguay, Namibia, Bolivia and Nigeria.The Internet speed in South Korea is nearly double that of the United States. The reasons for South Korea\u2019s fast Internet speeds are competition among many broadband carriers, a pro-technology culture, a relatively \u201copen-network\u201d system where companies share infrastructure, a dense population that reduces wiring needs,and a proactive government technology plan enacted in the 1990s.Mobile Connectivity by CountryInternet traffic through mobile network providers on devices such as smartphones or tablets has increased by 55% since last year.The fastest mobile connection speeds, on average, are in the United Kingdom (23.1 Mbps), Belgium (21.1 Mbps) Cyprus* (20 Mbps), Switzerland* (19.3 Mbps) and Germany (17 Mbps).The slowest mobile connection speeds, on average, are in Venezuela (2.2 Mbps), Vietnam (2.8 Mbps), Ecuador* (2.8 Mbps), Argentina (2.8 Mbps) and Panama* (2.9 Mbps).Note: An * indicates that fewer than 25,000 unique IPv4 addresses classified as mobile were observed.Comparison of Mobile Connectivity vs. All Internet AccessThe difference between mobile speeds and all Internet speeds can vary significantly in some countries. In the U.K., for example, the top speeds on mobile data average 23.1 Mbps, but the total average speeds are 15 Mbps. That means mobile speeds are 8.1 Mbps faster than all Internet access speeds.Another country that has a stark difference between mobile connectivity speeds and all Internet access, but in the opposite direction, is South Korea. Its total average speeds are 27 Mbps, much higher than the mobile network speeds of 11.1 Mbps.Fastest-Growing Internet SpeedsQatar, Egypt, Indonesia and Kenya all had average Internet speeds that increased more than 100% since the previous year. Notably, Kenya\u2019s Internet speeds increased by nearly 300%.The Internet speed growth for the 10 fastest-growing countries are:Kenya \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0297%Indonesia \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0148%Egypt \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0110%Qatar \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0101%Iran \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a087%South Africa \u00a0\u00a071%Thailand \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a063%Vietnam \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a058%Morocco \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a058%Saudi Arabia \u00a0\u00a0\u00a057%\u00a0200820092010201120122013201420152016Egypt3895286587091,1331,0501,2481,6862,428Indonesia9051,1068846197191,5302,3782,1634,543Iran6898454625046586291,3311,8853,536Kenya3473423714695437951,8731,8307,289Morocco1,9621,5841,6541,4941,1391,9102,3222,9024,253Qatar8671,4121,4281,6831,6472,1183,2086,9198,358Saudi Arabia1,3651,5412,2092,0342,2732,0343,2003,7944,653South Africa1,1201,2031,1211,4811,8282,1662,6033,3236,501Thailand7801,6312,7432,6453,1643,9235,1557,21510,769Vietnam8361,0701,6811,3651,6101,3832,0283,1595,030Sources: http://blog.rottenwifi.com/countries-best-public-wifi/ https://www.ipass.com/wifi-growth-map/ https://content.akamai.com/PG7075-q2-2016-soti-connectivity-report.html http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/03/31/broadband.south.korea/ https://www.akamai.com/us/en/our-thinking/state-of-the-internet-report/state-of-the-internet-connectivity-visualization.jsp Ooma TeloCrystal-clear nationwide calling.
