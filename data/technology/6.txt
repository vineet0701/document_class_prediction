Before the merger, Charter had about 6.8 million customers; afterward, Charter had 25.4 million customers in 41 states and became the second-largest US cable company after Comcast.The merger was quickly followed by customer complaints about pricing in the acquired territories. In November 2016, we noted\u00a0that \"tens of thousands of ex-Time Warner Cable video subscribers have canceled their service since the company was bought by Charter, and pricing changes appear to be the driving factor.\" At the time,\u00a0Charter CEO Thomas Rutledge explained that the TWC video customer base was \"mispriced\" and needed to be moved \"in the right direction.\"Charter came up with new prices and packages, and many customers saw their bills rise when their previous discounts expired and they were switched to non-promotional pricing.\u00a0Now, 30 percent of the ex-TWC and ex-Bright House customers are paying different\u2014and often higher\u2014prices.70 percent to goRutledge provided the\u00a0update in an earnings call last week\u00a0(hat tip to FierceCable). According to a Seeking Alpha transcript, Rutledge said:In June, we finished the rollout of our new pricing, packaging, and branding across our national footprint with the last launch of Spectrum in Hawaii. We now offer a simple, straightforward, high-value product using a consistent and uniform approach across our 50 million passings under one brand, Spectrum.The new product is succeeding with consumers across our footprint. In the second quarter, our customers and PSU [primary service unit] connects were higher year-over-year. And as of the end of the second quarter, 30 percent of Time Warner Cable and Bright House legacy customers were in our new pricing and packaging, up from 17 percent at the end of last quarter. In areas where we've had Spectrum in place for at least three quarters, 43 percent of our residential customers have Spectrum package products.We asked Charter for details on how many customers are paying higher prices than before,\u00a0but the company said it would not offer those numbers. \"These customers have chosen to move into these packages, which provide a greater value compared to legacy packages,\" a Charter spokesperson told Ars.The pricing changes also affected customers who were with Charter before the merger. \"Progression of product and package migration is virtually identical to what we saw at Legacy Charter,\" Rutledge said.Charter adds\u00a0Internet customers, loses TV subscribersCharter's total customer relationships increased by 211,000 during\u00a0Q2 2017. Charter has 26.8 million residential and business customers subscribed to at least one of the three triple-play services, the company's earnings release said. About 25.3 million of those are residential.Charter lost 90,000 residential TV subscribers in the quarter, while gaining 231,000 Internet subscribers and 14,000 phone customers. Charter now has 22 million residential Internet subscribers, 16.6 million TV subscribers, and 10.4 million phone subscribers.Further ReadingCharter losing Time Warner Cable TV customers as it imposes new pricingCharter's average monthly revenue per residential customer was $109.46, up\u00a0from\u00a0$109.11 the previous quarter. The number is slightly down from a year ago, when average customer revenue was $109.74. (Comcast raised its revenue per cable customer from $149.83 to $151.19 per month between the first and second quarter.)Charter wants to raise that average, but the increases in prices for some customers have been offset in part by customers buying Internet access\u00a0by itself without TV and phone service. \"[P]romotional rate step-ups and modest rate adjustments were offset by continued single-play Internet sell-in and the migration of Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House customers to higher-value Spectrum pricing and packaging,\" Charter said.The price changes for ex-TWC customers have resulted in many news stories. One such piece in the\u00a0Lexington Herald Leader of Kentucky in April profiled a customer who suddenly noticed that some of his TV channels were missing and replaced by \"a small block of text advising him that his subscription no longer provided those channels.\" The article says:A Spectrum representative told [the customer, Daniel] Fitzgerald that he hadn't been paying Time Warner [Cable] enough for the standard cable package. If he wanted those channels back, his monthly bill for cable and Internet would jump from $103 to $139, effective immediately.Also, he would need to pay a $24 service fee for a technician to replace his old Time Warner Cable box, which worked fine an hour earlier, with a new Spectrum cable box.Problems in Lexington were also detailed in\u00a0The New Yorker. Lexington officials have\u00a0scheduled a public hearing to evaluate Charter\u00a0later this month, but \"the city\u2019s franchise agreement and federal communications law gives the city little leverage with the cable company,\" the\u00a0Herald Leader wrote.Disclosure: The Advance/Newhouse Partnership, which owns about 13 percent of Charter, is part of Advance Publications. Advance Publications owns Cond\u00e9 Nast, which owns Ars Technica.Promoted CommentsZigZagPigSmack-Fu Master, in trainingjump to post \"These customers have chosen to move into these packages, which provide a greater value compared to legacy packages,\" a Charter spokesperson told Ars.I did not choose a different package. My bill jumped $20. I complained and they cut it $10. So, now I pay $10 more for the same internet only service - except Netflix and Amazon Prime now buffer a lot more. 11 posts | registered 8/22/2014 ten91Ars Centurionjump to postQuote:Charter CEO Thomas Rutledge explained that the TWC video customer base was \"mispriced\" and needed to be moved \"in the right direction.\"If TWC was able to operate at that price, then so should you. In fact it should be easier now that you have more resources right?
