The technology was detailed in a recently published technical paper, as well as a video (above) that shows the tech in action. With it, photographers are able to tweak an image's composition during post-processing.According to UCSB, computational zoom technology can, at times, allow for the creation of 'novel image compositions' that can't be captured using a physical camera. One example is the generation of multi-perspective images featuring elements from photos taken using a telephoto lens and a wide-angle lens.To utilize the technology, photographers must take what the researchers call a 'stack' of images, where each image is taken slightly closer to the subject while the focal length remains unchanged. The combination of an algorithm and the computational zoom system then determines the camera's orientation and position based on the image stack, followed by the creation of a 3D rendition of the scene with multiple views.\"Finally,\" UCSB researchers explain, \"all of this information is used to synthesize multi-perspective images which have novel compositions through a user interface.\"The end result is the ability to change an image's composition in real time using the software, bringing a photo's background seemingly closer to the subject or moving it further away, as well as tweaking the perspective at which it is viewed. Computational zoom technology may make its way into commercial image editing software, according to UCSB, which says the team hopes to make it available to photographers in the form of software plug-ins.

There are hundreds, nah maybe thousands, of articles that claim that zooming do not change the perspective. Sure, and we all knows it. It is the place you are standing at that defines the perspective, and not the focal length of your lens.But, is that really right? That zooming do not change the perspective? We have all seen it, the different perspective from a tele lens compared to the one from a wide angle.Put yourself at a street, take one wide angle picture along the street and one tele image. Look at them. Do they have the same perspective? Nope, they have visually totally different perspective. So, zooming do change the visual perspective, the perspective you see.Sure, you can crop the wide angle image and enlarge it, and it will look the same as the tele image (except it is poorer resolution). But, this is quite besides the point. The tele and the wide angle images looks to have different perspective. And that is what counts IMHO.Like01 day ago*permalinkStefanD Perspective is most often interpreted as the way that objects in a photo look related to each other. And that only changes when your location changes.An optically zoomed image is exactly the same as a digitally zoomed image (except regarding image detail of course)So you cannot change perspective by zooming. Just as you cannot zoom using your feet.Maybe you're using another definition for perspective....Like01 day agopermalinkRoland Karlsson I know that, and I also said it in the beginning. Yes, the actual perspective is only a function of the position you are standing at. Changing cameras, lenses, zooming etc will not change a thing to the actual perspective.But, I said, with tongue in cheek, that the \"visual perspective\" changes when you e.g. zoom. A wide angle picture has a totally different feel to the perspective than a tele picture. So, I actually think you change the feel of the perspective by zooming, as you really is taking another picture.Now, I know this will lead nowhere, but actually, I think it is important to understand this. One of the things you do when zooming is changing FOV, and different FOV do have different feel regarding perspective.You do not need to argue for or against ... I just wanted to let it out :)Like022 hours agopermalinkStefanD No problem with that :-)So now we have perspective and visual perspective. Great.Like011 hours agopermalinkMike FL I have a question that is the 105mm photo result of PP from 16mm original photo?Like01 day agopermalinkKirppu My first toughts... layersLike12 days agopermalinkJust A Plain Dude Is it maybe possible to have a narrator with clearer pronunciation?It was extremely painful to follow this one, sadly.Like02 days agopermalinkSRT201 I found him easily understandable. On top of that, his English is far better than my Hindi. :-)Like01 day agopermalinkAlex Velasco Clever. Soon we may need a tag next to every image byline appearing in the media to indicate whether there has been manipulation or not. E.g. Copyright Joe Blogs 2017 (No M.) (No Manipulation). Versus, Copyright Joe Blogs 2017 (M.) (Manipulated).Adding (No M.) to the byline will allow a photographer to emphasise the authenticity of the image.Like02 days agopermalinkmxx Reputable news media do that already, in the sense that they clearly state when an image has been manipulated other than the usual post processing for exposure, contrast etc.Like11 day agopermalinkojos azules Awesome. Lot of this compution will end up in the cameras. The sooner the better. Multiple pictures combined to increase resolution . Camera to automatically take the pictures needed for panorama etc etc. You will just hace to scan around without pushing the trigger. a 20fps camera with live view is in a good position to add thisLike12 days agopermalinkcosinaphile you have to walk toward the subject clicking all the way very little is actually automated here except a cut and paste algorithm to fuse multiple shots into fake multi perspective shotsLike12 days agopermalinkcosinaphile the one thing this program does not do is simulate zoomit tells me that the author does not understand what zooms do optically what this \"computational app does is simulate multiple primes shot at distances to allow a single foreground subject size to be maintained.... an important distinction when a zoom is pulled from say 35 to 135 it does not give you multiple perspectives it give you magnifications period it simulates [ well no it makes use of] shooting with a prime with multiple distances no zoom ever changes perspective period all visual relationships are fixed as a zoom moves you in closer simply crops out the exterior of the image by cropping the scene thru optical magnification what this program is simulating is multiple primes shot at different distances distances to simulate a fixed foreground subject size [ which it requires you to do by the way with a single prime at varying distances ]Like22 days ago*permalinks1oth1ovechunk Simulating a zoom is easy. It's called cropping.Like11 day agopermalinkRoland Karlsson What are you talking about? The article is totally consistent. The only slight glitch I can see is that it is called a \"computational zoom\", maybe a misnomer. But, for all I know, there is yet no well defined definition of a \"computational zoom\", so why not. They seem to be the first to use the term, so they kind of define it. And, it is a very fine old tradition to give new stuff totally wrong names.Like01 day agopermalinkM Chambers \"We'll fix it in post.\"Like12 days agopermalinksean lee good idea but unrealistic like editing in photoshop.Like02 days ago*permalinkKoolKool hmmm......look like dolly zoom, but for static imageah well, just let this interesing tech advances, we will see..... :)Like02 days ago*permalinklen_streets So you get to the spot with your model, pose the model and then just start shooting and walk past the model and just go on out of sight shooting and shooting.Like02 days agopermalinkGerard Hoffnung This is great news for all those professional photographers that plan on using their iPhone 7 for wedding photography. /s :)http://uk.businessinsider.com/ex-google-svp-vic-gundotra-praises-iphone-2017-7Like12 days agopermalinkThuravi Kumaaran great....Like02 days agopermalinkcosinaphile now this same story in business insider???Sorry i smell some manipulation ... ads masquerading as news...Like01 day agopermalinkUser3997598970 I shot an annular eclipse long ago.

(Or just license it to Apple or Samsung for a bundle of cash). Phones will soon be creators of all kinds of fake reality turning everyone in a supermodel or beefed up hunk who looks 25 forever. (or younger depending on the unhealthy life you lead).Like02 days ago*permalinkcosinaphile they can put whatever tricks in a tegra chip they want ... but they can get the tegra chip to walk toward the subject shooting all the while thats what the human operator will do ... this will just take visual data for a series of shots and cut and past from different images to simulateLike02 days agopermalinkRoss the Fidller I think I'll just take a few shots with my zoom lens & then use the best frame. ;)Like32 days ago*permalinkcosinaphile wisely said but you give up the perspective change just use a wide and a tele prime and walk back and forth taking your subjectLike02 days agopermalinkRoss the Fidller Yeah, but I can still exercise my feet (If it is possible for the scene) & save time playing at a computer. :DLike01 day agopermalinkChristop82 It took researchers from a college and a giant in imaging tech to create this? I'm pretty sure I can do this is photoshop. Only faster.Like02 days agopermalinkMatthew Miller You can't. Skip to 4:00 in the video.Like42 days agopermalinknokinonacynos This plus Apples fake bokeh will mean that you can get tele portraits with a phone!Like22 days agopermalinkRoland Karlsson no!Like32 days agopermalinkotto k It's tele-phone, of course it will be tele portrait ;)Like12 days agopermalinkDF58 Wow, think how that could have given a completely different perspective on the inauguration!Rather than Computational Zoom, let's call it \"Spicer Vision\" - in loving memory etc.Like12 days agopermalinkfalconeyes This is an application of \"structure from motion\" (google for it). The execution is rather well done, most applications lack the quality in results a photographer would need. Kudos to the researchers.Like22 days agopermalinkProfHankD Yeah, pretty much. It's basically creating a 3D (well, maybe 2.5D) model from a sequence of \"zoom by walking\" shots and then re-rendering the 3D model using potentially different perspectives for different depth regions. Like you, I'm pleasantly surprised by the apparent resulting image quality. However, the really new part is that different perspectives for different depths idea, and I'm not so sure that's a good thing....Like12 days agopermalinkThe Squire \"...Photographers are able to tweak an image's composition during post-processing.\"'Tweak' is an understatement.Like22 days agopermalinkNicolas Alexander Otto Basically this is automated focal length blending? I knew it was just a matter of time until someone came up with this. I see some photographers jumping on it to make mountains bigger and get absolutely unrealistic. :/Like72 days agopermalinkTom Holly Isn't it kinda pointless if you have to initially capture every perspective by walking thru the scene?Like42 days agopermalinkRoland Karlsson nope!Like22 days agopermalinkGeorge_P No. Cause the perspective you end up with, is impossible with a normal lens.Like12 days agopermalinkDr_Jon For \"straight\" Photography yes (plus what if stuff changes as you move), for some other uses maybe not.Like02 days agopermalinkRoland Karlsson The idea with the move was to document the unmovable track. That the girl moved did not matter as they did choose only one girl and modified the track. Personally I would have walked along the track without the girl, and then taken one image with the girl on the track.Like02 days agopermalinkBhima78 Agreed Tom. Better use would be for the algorithm to take say , one 36MP image and allow the final image to be around 8-12MP, then as you move the background closer, it automatically does perspective distortion correction as if you were using a longer lens. Of course, the final image would be smaller in resolution than the initial image, but it would be a bit more seemless when actually shooting.Like02 days agopermalinkRoland Karlsson @Bhima - how do you propose it shall do the perspective change, without having any perspective info?Like12 days agopermalinkTom Holly Roland,When you say it's not pointless to take all the photos (or video stream) to capture perspective info, what do you mean?Like022 hours agopermalinkTom Holly HI Bhima, yes it would be good if you could actually get it from one photo - and I thought that was what was being promised! But I think as Roland says, it's hard, because don't actually change the perspective by zooming in (either optically, or digitally afterwards).Like022 hours agopermalinkRoland Karlsson @Tom - I mean, that if you want to be able to do the stunt that this research can do, then you need to take pictures at different positions. Just taking one picture will not make it. So, therefore it is not pointless to take several images.Then, of course, you might think that this \"computational zoom\" thing is pointless, then reading this article is pointless :)Like022 hours agopermalinkTom Holly Roland thanks for clarifying what you meant.I don't think we are disagreeing.What I meant by \"pointless\" is - What's the point of a computer program which allows you to change perspective if you have to photograph all the different perspectives to begin with? It's a glorified filing system, simply giving back what you've already shot.Like020 hours agopermalinkDr_Jon I think the theory is you can simulate different focal length lenses at all those positions. So shoot with (say) 50mm at a bunch of locations then simulate 24mm at distance X or 85mm at distance Y.Like012 hours agopermalinkRoland Karlsson @Tom - the point is that you, by taking e.g. 10 images, can create lots of situations, both possible and impossible.Like011 hours agopermalinkTom Holly Yes I understand that Roland.I'm just not especially interested in card tricks that turn the queen of hearts into the ace of spades using nothing but a full deck of cards....Like09 hours agopermalinkRoland Karlsson Ah! But with this method you can turn it into a mix of 2.74 of spades and Kneen of hearts and this without having the whole deck.Like08 hours ago*permalinkTom Holly Yes you can your cards up and sticky tape them together with this method.But if I just wanted the jack of spades, I'd prefer to just start with it, rather build a whole deck and then work out how to find it.Like08 hours ago*permalinkRoland Karlsson Actually. This research result will probably lead nowhere. Just as zillions other fun stuff it will never be implemented in a serious product. So, the guy at this research lab can play around with it, until he is doing something else. Or maybe he get stuck and are bound to present this work again and again for several years in conferences and magazines.Like04 hours agopermalinkmiroshi Good for the software, but for me this is manipulating of images. And the result is something not existing.Like122 days agopermalinkRoland Karlsson yes!Like32 days agopermalinkRPJG Yes, images should only ever be allowed to show things that actually existed from perspectives that were actually used at the time. Art (and other uses) be damned. /sLike92 days ago*permalinkZnajomyZnajomego yes yes yes.Like02 days agopermalinkjnd So same as post editing in Photoshop? Often it result in ascene which never existed, albeit the difference can be in smaller details. Cameras already adjust lens aberration in background, software postprocessing is here to stay.Like02 days agopermalinktechjedi I guess color-blind people should only be allow to shoot in B&W? Are blind people allowed to even touch a camera? Might as well throw out infrared cameras and IR filter photography. </sarcasm>Like02 days agopermalinkBhima78 Right, not existing like smooth ocean water when shooting a seascape at slow shutter speeds.Like02 days agopermalinkCIASpook Seems like a lot of work.Like22 days agopermalinkSammy Yousef Yes it definitely looks like it would be easier to just put your subject in the image at different focal lengths and choose one when you get home.Like02 days agopermalinkSammy Yousef Or maybe just shoot your subject against a green screen.Like02 days agopermalinksts2 Or just take a picture which looks pleasing through the viewfinderLike72 days agopermalinkKristinnK It's a lot of work for the people that are designing the software. But if it is made into a consumer product you would simply input the image stack, then the software does the processing, and then you could simply manipulate 3 sliders to 1) change the perspective of the subject, 2) change the size (distance) of the foreground and 3) change the size (distance of the background.As others have noted this is image manipulation, i.e. you are creating an image that cannot be taken from any single perspective. But the process as these researchers are designing it is very efficient and streamlined.Like12 days agopermalinkCIASpook Kristinnk, the post work will be easy once the software is mature and you supply the content. It's the content that sounds like a lot of work to me. My attention span is not good enough to take enough photos to change the perspective in software later. it's an interesting technique, but too much work for me. So it's definitely not for me.Like01 day agopermalinkIrakly Shanidze this isn't exactly a breakthrough. several cine editing applications can do it. look for a dolly effect.Like02 days agopermalinkMike FL Can you, or some one, show us the name of PP tool or tools for dolly effect.I'm VERY interested.Like02 days ago*permalinkIrakly Shanidze https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1QKFnzISPwLike12 days agopermalinkMike FL Thanks. Other than this PP on video, Do you know the tools for still?Like02 days agopermalinkGeorge_P This is not the dolly effect. With this you can combine the 70mm look/perspective on your subject, and a 24mm look/perspective on your surroundings.Like02 days agopermalinkcosinaphile irakly your point is correct https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JubfQs7gpT0watch this ....lol at 4:11 insubject t is fixed...... while perspective changes ......exactly what this app purports to do...Like02 days ago*permalinkBhima78 It is changing perspective for the foreground, midground and background and allowing you to choose the perspective for each and composite one image with it. Not sure this is the same thing.Like02 days agopermalinkcosinaphile Respectfully it seems precisely the same.... if it differs and I'm missing something i welcome an opinionit varies perspective not zooming in any senseLike02 days ago*permalinkRedDog Steve Standing on the tracks ?Naughty, naughty.Like42 days agopermalinkBarty L It's a matter of perspective.Like62 days agopermalinkthx1138 Maybe the staff were railroaded into doing this!Like01 day agopermalinkcosinaphile also computational zoom is a silly name if anything its computational artificial series of primes computational camera movementLike22 days agopermalinkthx1138 OMG, tell you what, you come up with something this clever and name it what ever you want.Like182 days agopermalinkcosinaphile i at least will not call it computational zoom that is simply wrong its not zooming its changing perspective think about itLike62 days agopermalinkmgrum While we're on the subject magic erasers aren't actually magic, invisible socks aren't invisible and Hoverboards don't hover!Like32 days agopermalinkcosinaphile i urge everyone who owns a zoom to think about what it actually does,,,, oka wide to tele say a 24 to 90 will give you the perspective of the 24 period if you want to tighten in on a distant subject what that zoom will do for you is crop away the outside of the 24 image and give true optical magnificationof a small central portion of the image its a telescopic maGNIFICATION not in any sense a variance of perspectives .. which is achieved by moving closer or further to you subject physically,,, like on foot for instance i dont know how this can be made clearer... its not the easiest subject to wrap your head around for people used to zooms ... But just consider the reality that a zoom can never change perspective from a fixed position... you ...........must.......... moveLike02 days ago*permalinkcosinaphile https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JubfQs7gpT0 watch this ....lol at 4:11 inLike02 days agopermalinkdbateman No this is different.Tracking and zoom are diferent things and so is this. This however does seem to take a lot of work. Here they are pinning objects in the scene, allowing to move selective objects in and out. Like your video just with selcting the railing or the lights only.Like02 days agopermalinkcosinaphile in this software program the subject stays the same and the perspective changes the analogous video of this is at 4 11 in video its a difficult process on the other hand, this process requires taking multiple frames in focus[subject] while walking toward the subject .... then you need to put the images in the program and run the algorithm .... sounds like a lot of work for what is essentiaslly a glorified cut and paste program ... which frankly is kind of obvious lookingLike12 days agopermalinkcosinaphile the tracking and zoom feature RE DOING EXACTLY THE SAME THING ALLOWING THE PERSPECTIVE to change while the subject does not get larger or smaller it video but video is just a series of stills and its exactly the same thing .... think about itLike12 days agopermalinkImpulses Pretty interesting concept, seems some comments either didn't watch the clip or are getting bogged down in the semantics... I do question the practical application tho, how quickly can this be done on the fly? If it requires a ton of post processing (even if automated) in addition to recording a scene from multiple vantage points to begin with, that's quite a bit of extra work on both ends... And they only show it applied with people as subjects, tho I imagine the masking could be applied to anything.In the end it's just fancy stacking and layering aided by a lot of processing power... Seems like if they could combine this with stills pulled from 4K video (don't see why not) then you might start approaching something more seamless. A user could pull fancy photos with simulated/created focal lengths from one stream of video casually captured with one lens/camera.Like12 days agopermalinkYak27 If someone makes an app (with this technology) for a Tango enabled device, then I can imagine the process streamlined a bit. In such a system tracking and 3d reconstruction is happening in real-time. Thus minimizing post processing, increasing accuracy; both in 3d space camera position, in deciding when the pictures should be taken, and probably in the reconstruction itself. Because the device knows when to take the picture, it can it at full resolution.Also, in this workflow, a digital DOF effect can be added on. But I'm not sure without a Tango enabled device, if this would prove untrue.Like12 days agopermalinkbrn Reading the initial description, I didn't see much of an application for this. It comes off as a lot of effort to merely simulate a longer focal length.Watching the video, provides a much better understanding. You can create perspectives that don't exist in real life. Pretty neat.Like12 days agopermalinkKristinnK I think the most powerful example is the one that starts at 4:00 in the video (link below). You need the wide angle perspective to have the people not be dwarfed by the cross, but you need the long focal length to get the church to loom large in the background. There is literally no way to get the final image (4:14), you would have had to physically move the church closer.Of course the software isn't doing anything supernatural, it's just complex focal length blending. But showing it can be automated like that is quite a feat. A consumer software that takes the image stack as input and then allows you to adjust the foreground and background size with sliders would sell like hotcakes.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPxhBvPAdsI&t=4mLike12 days ago*permalinkrubank Ridiculous. Waste of time and space.There are a zillion ways to manipulate photos - been there, done that. This is nothing new.Zoom-by-feet and image stack? Come on!Like02 days agopermalinkHowaboutRAW There aren't zillions of ways of constructing different perspectives from static images.Like12 days agopermalinkcosinaphile https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JubfQs7gpT0 especially at about 4:11Like02 days ago*permalinkBhima78 @CosinaIts not the same thing at all.Like02 days agopermalinkdash2k8 Depending on how many images are required in the stack, this may or may not be a usable workflow. I could simply take three photos at different positions and do the editing myself in Photoshop. Granted, their software might work faster than me if it's automated, but I'm failing to see how this research is an advancement of what many of us can already do at home without government or corporate funding. Maybe someone can explain it to me?But as always, it's always great that people are pushing the tech and innovation boundaries. I'm all for it.Like02 days agopermalinkHowaboutRAW Bet it's been adapted from military surveillance tech.Like02 days agopermalinkRoland Karlsson Yeah - what shall I say. Fun stuff - there are lots of fun stuff in research - only a small percentage comes to users. I had some ideas on different projections when doing panorama images. Sure, there are research that fits my ideas perfectly. But no software you can buy or download.

If you want a compressed look, you back up and use a long lens. If you want a wide, grand look, you get close and use a wide. Zoom with feet.Like12 days ago*permalinkPhotoKhan \"2] they walk toward a subject3] shooting multiple images ... the only way to truly change perspective\"Then, the software uses those same changed perspectives to re-construct the perspective from the original POV (...like true zooming...) if that's what the user wants (...as the software can also create alternate perspectives, some of which are even non-natively obrtainable...) \"that is the very definition of zooming with your feet\"You did not understand what the software is set up to do.Like02 days agopermalinkcosinaphile https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JubfQs7gpT0 at 4:11 is what its doing [ but watch the whole video its very good the lessons apply to stills too as video which is just a series of stills ]i just think its a cheap software trick such effects can never be achieves with a zoom alone only changing positionits not at all like true zoomingLike02 days ago*permalinkPhotoKhan ...Jesus...Like12 days agopermalinkcosinaphile you left out mary and joseph as my mom used to exclaim. :)cheersLike02 days agopermalinkcosinaphile \"To utilize the technology, photographers must take what the researchers call a 'stack' of images, where each image is taken slightly closer to the subject while the focal length remains unchanged. \"am i missing something or is this just a variation of zoom with your feet? \"but computer \"apparently, n videa can take a bunch of images that i might take with one of my primes walking toward a subject and use a computer algorithm to play with them??i just watched the vid again .... i call computer jargonese overlaying a zoom with you feet event taking mulit images and a rather poor cut pasted series of faked perspectives app.... ummmmm nowhats the point the stack of images has the different perspectives alreadyLike12 days ago*permalinkGeorge_P No. It's not zooming with your feet. You missed the whole point.The whole point is to create an image that can have your subject at one focal length, then the background at a different focal length. (Just one example)What if you took a photo of two subjects that are in such different distances that you can't fit them both and have the perspective you like? This is a proposal of a technique to do just that.Like12 days agopermalinkcosinaphile if you say so a single focal lengthwalking toward subject multiple images ... stacked and manipulated , i think poorly in software all i see are cutouts a software cutout trick combining different parts of different images .... of a set of images.... you take with a single focal length achieved by walking toward the subject with a prime and i absolutely understand the goals of this software image fusing cutout trick is anything i said incorrect ?if you are impressed ... i will not press further cheersLike02 days ago*permalinkdash2k8 @george, and how did you think the stack of images was taken in the demo video above? By taking a bunch of images with a PRIME while moving forward incrementally... thus \"zoom with feet.\" Notice all the images in the stack had the same perspective. They were not taken with a 18-200mm from one spot.To answer your question, to solve that issue, according to this proposal you must take one shot at the wide end and another at the long end, and combine that... again, you'll be moving your feet. If you tried to cheat and take two shots at different zoom lengths, the resulting image will be unrealistic.Like02 days ago*permalinkcosinaphile you know dash you just made me realize something sometime in tv shows or movies when a character experiences something earthshaking or life changing or disastrous they will fix the camera on the subject horrified face they will do a trick where i think they simultaneously zoom and move the camera closer to maintain subject size while the environment distorts wildly ... i dont know what this is called ... but it seems similar to what this does for stillsedit ....found this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JubfQs7gpT0 see at 4:11...lolLike02 days ago*permalinkdash2k8 I know what you mean. I can't recall the name, either, but I know that effect and sometimes employ in my own videos.Like02 days agopermalinkSammy Yousef cosinaphilehttps://www.wired.com/2014/08/ABC-just-happened-vertigo-effect/Replace ABC in the URL above with W and T and F, because those 3 letters are picked up as swearing.\u201cdolly zoom,\u201d \u201cpush-pull,\u201d, \u201creverse-tracking shot,\u201d, \"Vertigo effect\"Like02 days agopermalinkcosinaphile its even weirder without a foreground subjectLike02 days agopermalinkMike CH Natural looking?

It will come the day that no longer one will need to carry a large zoom lens or will do without some lenses altoghether. Also, I was a computer programmer many many years ago, I can not grap my mind around the flow chart for the computer program that will generate this marvel.Like12 days agopermalinkBadScience It will come the day that lenses (as we know them) are not required at all; all the information about the light will be recorded as it hits a sensor and the image manipulated as you see fit.Like22 days agopermalinkstraylightrun Doubt it. Maybe if you are autistic etc or something and have no knolwedge of proper composition. There will always be creative people in the world.Like02 days agopermalinkBadScience thanks for the non-sequiter.Like02 days agopermalinkSammy Yousef You just have to distort the furthest image in the right way. Math. Lots of trig I presume. Along with deciding when to switch in the close image for higher detail. I'm not suggesting it is trivial or even easy but it's not that difficult to understand. And no this won't replace zoom lenses.Like02 days agopermalinkBadScience \"And no this won't replace zoom lenses\"Lenses as we know them, not just zooms, will one day be a thing of the past. And not to far in the future. A few decades at most. They are not needed. They are big, heavy, expensive, fragile.https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&q=ultra+thin+optical+array&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_sdtp=Like02 days agopermalinkdlb41 please stop the fake photography\ud83d\ude1eLike182 days agopermalinkcgarrard It won't catch on.
