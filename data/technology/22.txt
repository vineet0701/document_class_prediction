That doom and gloom has resulted in many predicting that revenue and profit would fall with declining iPhone sales, but Apple has once again pushed through those mythical barriers. Tim Cook was typically enthusiastic about iPhone performance through the earnings call:iPhone results were impressive, with especially strong demand at the high end of our lineup. iPhone 7 was our most popular iPhone and sales of iPhone 7 Plus were up dramatically compared to 6s Plus in the June quarter last year. The combined iPhone 7 and 7 Plus family was up strong double digits year over year.What\u2019s particularly interesting about Cook\u2019s words is that consumers have been responding to the high-end iPhone in higher rates over the last quarter. The numbers of individuals purchasing the larger 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus is higher this year than those opting for iPhone 6s Plus, which can likely be attributed to the upgraded hardware and hugely improved dual-lens camera experience. Interest in that hardware means that Apple is able to celebrate the tenth anniversary of iPhone with the realization that it\u2019s managed to shift 1.2 billion units.The celebrations will likely continue into the year as the company heads toward the launch of iOS 11 and the highly-anticipated iPhone 8. Apple is expected to unveil a dramatically redesigned device featuring a stunning edge-to-edge display and facial recognition which will presumably be used in place of the Touch ID experience.That release will also see iOS 11 introduced to the general public, featuring a fully redesigned Control Center experience which puts the relevant controls and toggles directly into the user\u2019s hands, among many other things.You may also like to check out:Download Hotspot Shield++ IPA Of VPN App On iOS 10 [No Jailbreak Required]Download Windows 10 S ISO Image File Directly From MicrosoftiOS 10.3.2 Jailbreak Might Be Possible After Userspace Research Tool By Ian Beer Has Been ReleasedDownload iOS 10.3.3 Final IPSW Links For iPhone, iPad, iPod touchJailbreak iOS 10.3.3\u00a0/ 10.3.2\u00a0/ 10.3.1 / 10.3 For iPhone And iPad [Latest Status Update]Download iOS 11 Beta 4\u00a0& Install On iPhone 7, 7 Plus, 6s, 6, SE, 5s, iPad, iPod [Tutorial]You can follow us on\u00a0Twitter, add us to your circle on\u00a0Google+\u00a0or like our\u00a0Facebook page\u00a0to keep yourself updated on all the latest from Microsoft, Google, Apple and the Web.Related StoriesTweet Subscribe to our RSS Feed !Like this post on FacebookRedmond Pie ChannelsFollow Us On FacebookSubscribe To RSS FeedFollow Us On TwitterSubscribe On YouTubeJamesJeezus that\u2019s a lot of phones.Poppa-sanThe iPhone 6 was a piece of shit, and I\u2019m pretty sure it helped fuel sales with all the folks who jumped ship earlier than they would have normally.MathewSullivanIts kinda insane to think that about 15% of the people in the world own an iPhone.(numbers are not a reflection of true analysis, re-fuckin-lax)Subscribe To Redmond Pie Follow @RedmondPiePopular StoriesRedmond Pie's Latest\u00a0\u00a0Recent Stories How To Fix Kodi 17 Video Stuttering Issue On Fire TV Stick / Raspberry PiAugust 5th, 2017 | Paul Morris Boxy 3 Brings Icon Layout Customization To iOS 10 Home ScreenAugust 5th, 2017 | Oliver Haslam Download: Kodi 17.4 Nightly Now AvailableAugust 5th, 2017 | Paul Morris Unicode 11 To Feature 67 New Emoji Including Frowning Poo, Here\u2019s The Full ListAugust 5th, 2017 | Oliver Haslam We Might Get iPhone SE 2 In Early 2018August 5th, 2017 | Oliver Haslam Copyright \u00a9 2008-2017 Redmond Pie.
