Boeing clearly likes fun because for the last 14 hours a 787 Dreamliner has been tracing the outline of a plane above the United States. By my count, this outline hits 17 states and spans from Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula to the tip of Texas.As of this post\u2019s writing, the outline is nearly complete. The plane will then have to make its way back to Seattle. It\u2019s scheduled to land at 9:24 PDT. You can watch the test live here.According to various sources, this flight was not a frivolous waste of fuel. Boeing is using the long flight to test a new set of Rolls Royce engines.This flight path keeps the Dreamliner in the air for 17 hours and 46 minutes and will cover 9,896 miles. That\u2019s longer and farther than the longest commercial route, which links Doha, Qata to Auckland, New Zealand and takes 16 hours, 10 minutes to cover the 9,021 mile distance.Editor\u2019s note: A previous revision of this post stated the distance listed in the flight plan but has now been updated to reflect the actual amount of flown miles.0SHARESAdvertisementAdvertisement Newsletter SubscriptionsThe Daily CrunchGet the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inboxTC Weekly RoundupGet a weekly recap of the biggest tech storiesCrunchbase DailyThe latest startup funding announcementsEnter AddressSubscribeSEE ALL NEWSLETTERS \u00bb Latest Crunch Report Coinbase Reverses Stance on Bitcoin Cash | Crunch ReportWatch More EpisodesPopular Posts Featured Stories Markets are strong, but big startup M&A deals just aren\u2019t\u00a0happening3 hours ago | Joanna Glasner How Apple could become a $1 trillion\u00a0company4 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Tesla lowers Model X base price due to improved\u00a0margins6 hours ago | Darrell Etherington The next Apple Watch reportedly won\u2019t need an iPhone for\u00a0data22 hours ago | Greg KumparakLatest From TechCrunch All the major cases where an LTE-enabled Apple Watch would be\u00a0great1 hour ago | Matthew Lynley Snap\u2019s earnings this week will once again test its place in the advertising\u00a0universe1 hour ago | Matthew Lynley Markets are strong, but big startup M&A deals just aren\u2019t\u00a0happening3 hours ago | Joanna Glasner How Apple could become a $1 trillion\u00a0company4 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Comment moderation powered by Up NextTesloop does emission-free electric freight shipping \u2013 with a Tesla Model\u00a0XPosted Aug 3, 2017 CrunchBoardJob ListingsDevOps Engineer @ Telmate at Telmate (San Francisco, CA, United States)Senior Android Developer @ Telmate at Telmate (San Francisco, CA, United States)Senior Software Engineer @ HintMD at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States)Software Engineer at GreenSlate (New York, NY, United States)Data Scientist at National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (St. Louis, MO, United States)More from CrunchBoardAdvertisementTechCrunchNewsVideoEventsCrunchbaseTechCrunch StoreAboutStaffContact UsAdvertise With UsEvent & Editorial CalendarSend Us A TipActivations BlogInternationalChinaEuropeJapanFollow TechCrunchFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInYoutubePinterestTumblrInstagramStumbleUponFeedTechCrunch AppsiOSAndroidWindows 8Subscribe to The Daily CrunchLatest headlines delivered to you dailySubscribe to <span class=\"no-mobile\">Subscribe to </span>The Daily CrunchEnter Email AddressSubscribe \u00a9 2013-2017 Oath Inc.
