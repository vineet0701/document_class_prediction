(SGI), looking something like a super-sized equipment cart.Recommended for YouDrones Have Found a Niche in the Insurance BusinessNew Natural Gas Power Plants Are Automating Out JobsA Different Story from the Middle East: Entrepreneurs Building an Arab Tech EconomyFirst Human Embryos Edited in U.S.How Quantum Physics Is About to Revolutionize BiochemistryThe device is actually conglomeration of small machines and lab robots, linked to each other to form one big machine. But this one can do something unprecedented: it can use transmitted digital code to print viruses.In a series of experiments culminating last year, SGI scientists used genetic instructions sent to the device from elsewhere in the building to automatically manufacture the DNA of the common flu virus. They also produced a functional bacteriophage, a virus that infects bacterial cells. \u00a0Although that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the first time anyone had made a virus from DNA parts, it was the first time it was done automatically, without human hands.The device, called a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdigital-to-biological converter\u00e2\u0080\u009d was unveiled in May. Though still a prototype, instruments like it could one day broadcast biological information from sites of a disease outbreak to vaccine manufacturers, or print out on-demand personalized medicines at patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 bedsides.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have been dreaming, for about a decade, of the ability to fax life forms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Juan Enriquez, an executive with Excel Ventures, a venture capital firm that has invested in SGI, who imagines a new Industrial Revolution with the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdigital-biological converter\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the cotton gin.Craig Venter, the renegade biologist who founded Synthetic Genomics in 2005, but no longer takes a day-to-day role in its activities, has said he even thinks it will be possible to transmit life forms between planets.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talked to Elon Musk\u00e2\u0080\u009d about it, says Dan Gibson, SGI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president for DNA Technology.Flu virusesUnlike Venter, known for boasts and big scientific plans, Gibson is understated, although also well-known among biologists for \u00e2\u0080\u009cGibson Assembly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a reaction that joins small pieces of lab-made DNA into much larger genes.SGI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BioXP 3200, a commercial DNA printer, forms the heart of the digital-to-biological converter. When Gibson, sitting in his office, sends a message to the converter, it begins its work using pre-loaded chemicals. He could just as easily send such a message from anywhere.\u00a0\u00a0In late May, Gibson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team disclosed how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d used the device to create DNA, RNA, proteins, and viruses \u00e2\u0080\u009cin an automated fashion from digitally transmitted DNA sequences without human intervention.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWork on the converter began around 2013, when SGI and Novartis, the drugmaker, ran a test to see if they could use data from flu outbreaks to very quickly construct seed viruses, from which vaccines are made.Their chance came in March of that year when Chinese authorities reported H7N9 flu infections and posted the bug\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DNA sequence data online. (The H and the N in flu types refer to hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, proteins on the outer shell of viruses that are recognizable by the human immune system.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was Easter Sunday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gibson recalls, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen I got an e-mail that H7N9 bird flu was causing quite a scare in China. So we were very quickly able to get the DNA sequence.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTwo days later, without direct access to any specimens, only the digitized sequences, SGI had synthesized the H and N genes on Gibson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DNA printer. Those DNA strands were shipped to Novartis, which used them to generate virus stocks containing the new genetic information\u00e2\u0080\u0094the kind used in vaccine production. Gibson says that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when the idea for the digital-to-biological converter became real. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said \u00e2\u0080\u0098Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we integrate everything into one box?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he recalls.Gibson hopes to turn the device into a profitable business. Imagine, he says, that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta unravels the genetic instructions for an antibody to a disease like Ebola threatening to create an epidemic. That code could be streamed digitally to converters at \u00e2\u0080\u009cevery hospital around the world\u00e2\u0080\u009d to start making the antidote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something I believe is going to happen, not in the far future.\u00e2\u0080\u009dError problemsEven though the ability to program life and have it appear in different places is startling, just how useful biological teleportation will be remains debatable. Creating a small amount of seed virus stock is important, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only one step in manufacturing enough vaccine for a whole country. The weakened viruses that go into flu shots usually have to be grown by the trillions in chicken eggs\u00e2\u0080\u0094a carefully planned process that takes half a year.\u00a0And the DNA strands made by SGI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s converter still suffer from errors, or random mutations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis mutation rate would be unacceptably high if you are trying to make \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 vaccines or pharmaceuticals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d University of Alberta virologist David Evans said in an e-mail. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe FDA would have a cow.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEven so, Evans says that \u00e2\u0080\u009calthough there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much novelty in any particular step, putting them all together to make functional DNA come out at the back end is quite impressive \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Fix the error problem and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have a device everyone would want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0Gibson says he is attacking the error rate problem and is also trying to shrink the converter to a manageable size. Right now, it now occupies about the same space as a Fiat 500 car.PanspermiaSGI has not \u00e2\u0080\u009cprinted life\u00e2\u0080\u009d just yet\u00e2\u0080\u0094most biologists do not regard a virus as being alive. But they might get there. In 2016, SGI announced the creation of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cminimal cell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a bacterium with the smallest-ever genome and which could serve as a kind of blank cassette to accept new genetic instructions. Gibson says that since the \u00e2\u0080\u009cminimal cell is the simplest form of life\u00e2\u0080\u009d it might be logical to try to print one.Some of SGI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backers, including Venter, are hinting that the ultimate job for a life printer would be to send life back and forth between planets. In one scenario a sequencing machine could be sent to Mars to obtain the genetic code of any life forms, or near-life forms, found there.That data could them be transmitted to an earthbound converter, which would reconstruct the alien life, perhaps in a high-security lab. An SGI team spent time with NASA scientists in the barren Mojave desert in 2013 testing aspects of the theory. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe loaded up a research lab bus with all the stuff we needed, isolated some samples and sequenced them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gibson says. \u00a0Sending life data into space could be even more interesting. According to one theory of how life emerged on Earth, known as panspermia, it was carried here on a meteor or comet. Sending biological converters into space could be mankind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way of returning the favor, Enriquez says, seeding life elsewhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI [want] to do something out of this world, to send one of these things to Mars and print fuels, or print part of an atmosphere, or nutrients,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.This invites the question of what life form, or what genetic sequence, would be first to go. Venter famously (and secretly) used his own DNA as the basis for the first human genome sequence of an individual person, published in 2003.When asked if Venter now intended to reproduce his genome on another planet, both Gibson and Enriquez said the same thing: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo comment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Become an MIT Technology Review Insider for in-depth analysis and unparalleled perspective.Subscribe today CreditImage courtesy of DBCBrian AlexanderGuest ContributorBrian Alexander is a writer based in California.
