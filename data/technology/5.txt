The FCC has long utilized a company by the name of SamKnows to track real-world broadband network performance using customer firmware-embedded routers in the homes of thousands of volunteers. Stop the Cap notes that while Charter's own speedtests don't show any problems, objective data indicates Charter is struggling to meet demand in some markets. \"A closer examination of daily speed test results over the last year show that while ordinary speed tests using Charter-hosted speed test servers or websites don\u2019t always show a problem, independent tests of network traffic performance in areas bypassed for upgrades are showing signs of traffic jams,\" notes the website.While Charter promised the moon, sea and stars when it was selling regulators on its planned acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, the company actually froze many ongoing speed upgrades at these acquired companies post merger. Charter also recently found itself on the receiving end of a lawsuit by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who accused the company of knowing full well that it was advertising speeds it technically couldn't deliver. \"During the last quarter of daily periodic testing, a customer that used to subscribe to Time Warner Cable\u2019s 50/5Mbps service and routinely got those speeds no longer does after switching to Charter/Spectrum\u2019s 60Mbps plan,\" notes the website.\"Customers question where the bottleneck is, because when they test broadband speeds using the company\u2019s own test tools, they usually find their broadband speeds are above what is advertised,\" the site adds. \"But independent, regularly conducted speed tests by third-party organizations reveal problems. One customer noted for the month of July, he received a minimum of 27.3Mbps, a maximum of 70.1Mbps, but an average of only 47.6Mbps from Spectrum\u2019s basic 60Mbps plan -- less than what he was able to get from Time Warner Cable\u2019s 50Mbps Ultimate Internet.\"Charter customers: have you seen better or worse network performance in the wake of Charter's latest blockbuster megadeal?tags: competition \u00b7 business \u00b7 bandwidth \u00b7 consumers \u00b7 CharterNews Jump Reminder: ISPs Offer Private Support Right Here in Our ForumsFriday Morning Links 65,000 Frustrated DSL Customers Fled CenturyLink Last QuarterDish Lost Another 196,000 TV Customers Last QuarterWeekend Open Thread!194 US ISPs Now Impose Some Form of Usage CapsVerizon's New Rewards Program Tracks Your Internet UsageThursday Morning Links Charter: Just 30% of Acquired Customers on Spectrum Pricing\u00bbSome Users See Network Slowdowns in Wake of Charter Merger----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussedMost recommended from 31 comments ArrayListDevOpsPremium Memberjoin:2005-03-19Roslindale, MA2 recommendations ArrayList Premium Member2017-Aug-3 10:52 amsamknows is great sure would be nice if they supported gigabit connections. grrractions \u00b7 2017-Aug-3 10:52 am \u00b7 Nucleartxjoin:2016-09-08Belton, TX339.4 24.4\u00b7Time Warner Cable\u00b7AT&T Business2 recommendations Nucleartx Member2017-Aug-3 11:01 amEvening slowdownsI've noticed between 6-9pm my downlink speeds do slow slightly, around 250mbps. With ~150 homes on my node, I'm surprised I don't have more slowdowns. Of course, that number is based on total homes in the wired area. When maxed out, I'm taking 1/3 of all available bandwidth. We are running 24x4 the last I checked. actions \u00b7 2017-Aug-3 11:01 am \u00b7 Simba7I Void Warrantiesjoin:2003-03-24Billings, MT2 recommendations Simba7 Member2017-Aug-3 12:20 pmMessed upCharter messes up yet another network they have acquired.
