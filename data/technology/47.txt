In a statement issued on April 25, Ben Gomes, the company\u2019s vice president for engineering, stated that Google\u2019s update of its search engine would block access to \u201coffensive\u201d sites, while working to surface more \u201cauthoritative content.\u201dThe World Socialist Web Site has obtained statistical data from SEMrush estimating the decline of traffic generated by Google searches for 13 sites with substantial readerships. The results are as follows:* wsws.org fell by 67 percent* alternet.org fell by 63 percent* globalresearch.ca fell by 62 percent* consortiumnews.com fell by 47 percent* socialistworker.org fell by 47 percent* mediamatters.org fell by 42 percent* commondreams.org fell by 37 percent* internationalviewpoint.org fell by 36 percent* democracynow.org fell by 36 percent* wikileaks.org fell by 30 percent* truth-out.org fell by 25 percent* counterpunch.org fell by 21 percent* theintercept.com fell by 19 percentOf the 13 web sites on the list, the World Socialist Web Site has been the most heavily affected. Its traffic from Google searches has fallen by two thirds.The new statistics demonstrate that the WSWS is a central target of Google\u2019s censorship campaign. In the twelve months preceding the implementation of the new Google protocols, the WSWS had experienced a substantial increase in readership. A significant component of this increase was the product of Google search results. The rapid rise in search traffic reflected the well-documented growth in popular interest in socialist politics during 2016. The rate of growth accelerated following the November election, which led to large protests against the election of Trump.Search traffic to the WSWS peaked in April 2017, precisely at the point when Google began the implementation of its censorship protocols.Another site affected by Google\u2019s action has provided information that confirms the findings of the WSWS.\u201cIn late May, changes to Google\u2019s algorithm negatively impacted the volume of traffic to the Common Dreams website from organic Google searches,\u201d said Aaron Kaufman, director of development at progressive news outlet Common Dreams. \u201cSince May, traffic from Google Search as a percentage of total traffic to the Common Dreams website has decreased nearly 50 percent.\u201dThe extent and impact of Google\u2019s actions prove that a combination of techniques is being employed to block access to targeted sites. These involve the direct flagging and blackballing of the WSWS and the other 12 sites listed above by Google evaluators. These sites are assigned a highly negative rating that assures that their articles will be either demoted or entirely bypassed. In addition, new programming technology teaches the computers to think like the evaluators, that is, to emulate their preferences and prejudices.Finally, the precision of this operation strongly suggests that there is an additional range of exclusion techniques involving the selection of terms, words, phrases and topics that are associated with socialist and left-wing websites.This would explain why the World Socialist Web Site, which focuses on issues such as war, geopolitics, social inequality and working class struggles has experienced such a dramatic fall in Google-generated searches on these very topics. We have seen that the very terms and phrases that would under normal circumstances be most likely to generate the highest level of hits\u2014such as \u201csocialism,\u201d \u201cMarxism\u201d and \u201cTrotskyism\u201d\u2014produce the lowest results.This is an ongoing process in which one can expect that Google evaluators are continuously adding suspect terms to make their algorithm ever more precise, with the eventual goal of eliminating traffic to the WSWS and other targeted sites.The information that has been gathered and published by the WSWS during the past week exposes that Google is at the center of a corporate-state conspiracy to drastically curtail democratic rights. The attack on free speech and uncensored access to information is aimed at crippling popular opposition to social inequality, war and authoritarianism.The central and sinister role of Google in this process demonstrates that freedom of speech and thought is incompatible with corporate control of the Internet.As we continue our exposure of Google\u2019s assault on democratic rights, we demand that it immediately and unequivocally halt and revoke its censorship program.It is critical that a coordinated campaign be organized within the United States and internationally against Google\u2019s censorship of the Internet. We intend to do everything in our power to develop and contribute to a counter-offensive against its efforts to suppress freedom of speech and thought.The fight against corporate-state censorship of the Internet is central to the defense of democratic rights, and there must be a broad-based collaboration among socialist, left and progressive websites to alert the public and the widest sections of the working class.Andre Damon and David North\u00a0Commenting Discussion Rules \u00bbPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.New TodayChina rejects Trump\u2019s accusations
