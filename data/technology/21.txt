And there are over a dozen different manufacturers supplying voting machines to electoral districts. While that clunkiness helps prevent large-scale voter hacking, it provides more opportunities for hackers to access polling data.AdvertisementWhen US government workers decommission old voting equipment and auction them off to the public, they\u2019re\u00a0supposed to wipe voter information from the device\u2019s memory.But hackers given access to an ExpressPoll-5000 electronic poll book\u2014the kind of device used to check in voters on Election Day\u2014have discovered the personal records of 654,517 people who voted in Shelby Country, Tennessee.It\u2019s unclear how much of the personal information wasn\u2019t yet public. Some of the records, viewed by Gizmodo at the Voting Village, a collection of real, used voting machines that anyone could tinker with at the DEF CON hacker conference in Las Vegas, include not just name, address, and birthday, but also political party, whether they voted absentee, and whether they were asked to provide identification.AdvertisementElection Systems and Software (ES&S), which makes the ExpressPoll-5000, is one of the most popular e-poll book manufacturers in the country, said Barbara Simons, who sits on the board of Verified Voting, a nonpartisan research group that advocates for voting-machine security. There\u2019s no formal auditing process for how many of the machines are properly wiped, and thus no way to estimate how many machines have been sold that inadvertently contain voter records.But the fact that only a handful of such machines were made available at DEF CON and one of them had personal records that were so easily available doesn\u2019t inspire confidence, said Matt Blaze, a renowned security researcher who has authored several studies on voting machine security and who helped organize the village.\u201cHow many other of these machines that also have data left on them have been sold to who knows who? There\u2019s no way of knowing,\u201d Blaze told Gizmodo.After being sold at government auction, many machines are later resold, often for a few hundred dollars. Harri Hursti, a voting machine expert who famously found a critical flaw in Diebold voting systems, helped coordinate the machines\u2019 purchase for the conference by scouring eBay. The one seller he visited in person before buying had filled an entire warehouse with voting machines bought at auction, he said.Anyone with access to such a device\u2014whether on Election Day or while playing with an ExpressPoll-5000 at home\u2014would need only moderate computer skills to check for those records. They\u2019re stored on a removable memory card. Anyone who pulls out the drive and reads the memory card with their computer will see the drive\u2019s contents, including the giant database of personal records, if it hasn\u2019t been wiped.Josh Palmer, the security researcher who first discovered the database, said that once he held the memory card and a reader that connected to his laptop, it was simply a matter of finding and loading the giant file.Advertisement\u201cIt\u2019s just on the drive,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cThere was no password on it.\u201d ES&S \u201ccould have encrypted it,\u201d to at least give a baseline protection for voters, Palmer said. \u201cThey chose not to encrypt it.\u201dES&S didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Soon after Palmer\u2019s discovery, the conference confiscated the card to protect the voters included in the database. \u201cWe\u2019re notifying the county and letting them know of a potential data breach,\u201d Blaze said. AdvertisementA public relations consultant who represents Shelby County Elections Commission, Suzanne Thompson Cozza, said that the commission is \u201caware of the allegations about the happenings at DEF CON, and we are currently looking into it,\u201d but declined to elaborate.The privacy breach, however, isn\u2019t the full extent of problems with the ExpressPoll-5000. Even though the device doesn\u2019t tally actual vote results, and instead simply registers voters at a polling place, a compromised machine\u2019s lack of security could be used to disenfranchise tens or hundreds of thousands of voters on voting day. Electronic poll books are often simply given to election officials for safekeeping. There\u2019s no comprehensive look at how effectively those officials keep their machines, but some store them at home, and it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re not always kept secure. In April, before the runoff vote in Georgia\u2019s special congressional election, a thief stole four e-poll books from the pickup truck of a poll manager while he shopped for groceries.AdvertisementIf someone were to covertly access the memory card before the election, they could mark some or all users as having already voted absentee, preventing them from casting their actual vote. \u201cI could write a script to do that in seconds,\u201d Palmer said.Recommended StoriesEvery Voting Machine at This Hacking Conference Got Totally PwnedFacebook Shells Out $500,000 For Project to Fight Election HackingThe Politics of Hacking in the Age of TrumpYou may also likeSplinterComedian Pauly Shore Re\u2013Emerges as Pompous White HouseAdviser Stephen MillerToday 10:13amCompeteNumber One Dad Subs In For Son's Rocket League MatchToday 1:55pmLifehackerSubscribe to Notifications on Facebook Posts Rather Than CommentingToday 2:05pmPopular from Gizmodo292.9KGizmodoUber Can't Find a Woman to Be CEO, So Has Bravely Narrowed Their Search Down to Three DudesToday 3:05pm2286.7Kio9Sorry Dorne, Your Leader Isn't Coming Back on Game of Thrones50 minutes ago43419.5KGizmodoUS Army to Troops: Immediately Stop Using Off-the-Shelf DJI Drones, Especially on the BattlefieldToday 11:58amShareTweetAbout BlogNeed Help?Content GuideGizmodo StoreRedirecting to the Gizmodo store in Disclaimer: You are leaving a Gizmodo Media Group, LLC website and going to a third party site, which is subject to its own privacy policy and terms of use.ContinuePermissionsPrivacyTerms of UseAdvertisingJobsRSS\u00a92017 Gizmodo Media GroupKinja is in read-only mode.
