Some streets are so steep there are funiculars to help you scale them, and Lisboetas on bikes are a rare sight outside of summer.Like many hilly cities around the world, Lisbon has a serious congestion problem, and its urban planners know that if more people were persuaded to cycle they could reap huge benefits in air quality, health and liveability.Enter the electric bike. In June Lisbon unleashed 100 public hire bikes \u2013 two thirds of them electric \u2013 on the streets of the leafy Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es neighbourhood. They are available to beta testers across 10 docking stations, via an app. The wider scheme will eventually comprise 1,410 bikes: 940 electric to cope with the city\u2019s hills, the rest conventional bikes. They will be linked by a 100-mile network of cycle routes. Lisbon certainly isn\u2019t the first hilly city to look to e-bikes. Madrid introduced BiciMAD, a 100% electric public bike rental service in June 2014. London\u2019s hilliest neighbourhood, Muswell Hill, was once promised its own e-bike hire network, although the idea fizzled out. In June this year, San Francisco got its first 100 electric bikes via Social Bicycles, the company which is also rolling out an e-bike scheme in the UK\u2019s hilly seaside city of Brighton. Transportation planners in hilly cities around the world \u2013 from Hong Kong to Rio, Rome to Swansea \u2013 could take note.

According to Lisboa Horizontal, a project that sought to map the city\u2019s gradients for cycling, 63% of all the city\u2019s streets are less than 4%. Luckily for city planners, the modern part of Lisbon where most locals live and work is relatively flat. What\u2019s more, campaigners say it is possible to avoid the very steepest hills for most journeys. \u201cMost relevant routes aren\u2019t too hilly; it\u2019s possible to get from the river to the castle without an excessively steep hill,\u201d says local cycle tour guide, Ricardo Ferreira. \u201cIf you move to the city you know how to get around \u2013 and there\u2019s no shame to walk for 100 or 200 metres.\u201d Pedro Machado, who works for Emel, Lisbon\u2019s transport body, says the bikes will be placed in the flatter parts of Lisbon \u2013 the plateau area and the riverfront. Although the e-bikes are there to help with hills, that\u2019s not their only purpose.\u201c[We\u2019re focusing on] cycling on the outskirts because it\u2019s a plateau, which covers more than half of the city,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have seven hills and they\u2019re all in the city centre.\u201cMadrid has [shown that] e-bikes solve the problem of hills but they also give you more range. If you\u2019re comfortable riding 3km on a regular bicycle, then you\u2019ll be comfortable doing 8km on an e-bike, so it captures people that would not be able to use a normal bike.\u201d Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Lisboa Horizontal project mapped the city\u2019s many flat(ish) streetsPortugal has among the lowest levels of cycling in Europe and highest motor vehicle ownership levels, but the aspirational imagery for Lisbon\u2019s cycle hire scheme is indicative of an administration trying to shift the perception of pedal power.Emel has invested \u20ac23m (\u00a320.6m) in the cycle hire project, contracting Portuguese bike company, Orbita, to design and produce the bikes, stations and docks, and maintain the system for eight years. An annual pass, available to residents, will cost \u20ac36 and a daily ticket \u20ac10 \u2013 a pricing which allows Lisbon to cash in on its tourism boom. The bikes will also carry advertising.\u201cLisbon is a city which has high commuting patterns,\u201d Machado says. \u201cWe get a lot of people in the morning coming from the outside; that\u2019s a problem that can go on for two hours.\u201dThe scheme is already proving popular. There are 2,400 beta testers, with a 3,500-strong waiting list. Many using the bikes now do so daily, according to Emel\u2019s Diogo Homem, saving up to 15 minutes each way per trip.More docking stations are being installed. This month and next, hire bikes will appear in districts including the touristic Baixa, the Zona Ribeirinha and Lisbon Plateau, as well as along the riverfront.

Photograph: Horacio Villalobos/Corbis via Getty ImagesLisbon planners hope that by building complementary infrastructure people will feel safe cycling on the streets. The 100-mile cycle network will stretch across the city to the municipal borders, with six main bike avenues for faster, longer journeys, linked by second and third hierarchy connecting paths on quieter streets within neighbourhoods. There will be measures including 20mph speed limits and narrower road widths to calm traffic, all tacked on to an existing programme of street improvements.In January Emel took control of the city\u2019s bus services, and is now introducing electric vehicles, and linking services with other modes of transport. Crucially, it also controls parking, and is using this revenue to help fund its cycling programme.Change isn\u2019t easy for everyone to swallow. Nuno Sardinha, a project manager at Emel, describes the firm as \u201cthe most hated company in Lisbon\u201d.\u201cThe way that we see it,\u201d Machado says, \u201cthe parking and mobility company is a tool that the city uses to regulate the use of public space and control the number of cars coming from the outside the city.\u201dCan e-bikes revolutionise long-distance commuting? Read moreOn Lisbon\u2019s first protected bike route \u2013 which runs along Avenida da Rep\u00fablica, a busy arterial road \u2013 Jo\u00e3o Bernardino and Pedro Sanches from local cycle campaign group, MUBi, explain that getting cycling infrastructure in the city has been a slow process, riddled with compromise and delay. These cycle tracks were originally intended for both sides of the road, but were reduced to a single two-way track amid concerns over a loss of parking.\u201cBad parking is like a plague in this city, and police just walk by,\u201d Sanches tells me. On one new cycle route that passes the local cycle caf\u00e9, V\u00e9locit\u00e9 Caf\u00e9, and crosses Avenida da Rep\u00fablica, a veritable forest of bollards has been planted across the new pedestrian space to prevent drivers leaving their cars there. We are forced to dodge cars parked where the bike route crosses side streets. Across the city, pavements and pedestrian crossings are regularly blocked by vehicles.On a national level, though, Portugal ended a give-way rule for cyclists in 2014, scrapped rules confining cycles to bike paths and introduced a 1.5-metre overtaking rule for drivers. Campaigners say the city has become more cycle friendly. As Sanches puts it: \u201cMost days now we can ride from home to work without any problems \u2013 that has changed.\u201dFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, and explore our archive hereTopicsCitiesCycling the cityLisbon holidaysPortugalPortugal holidaysEurope holidaysEuropenewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content View all comments >Order by newestoldestrecommendationsShow 252550100AllThreads collapsedexpandedunthreadedLoading comments\u2026 Trouble loading?View more commentsmost viewed The Guardianback to tophomeUKworldselectedsportfootballopinionculturebusinesslifestylefashionenvironmenttechtravelall sectionsclosehomeUKeducationmediasocietylawscotlandwalesnorthern irelandworldselectedeuropeUSamericasasiaaustraliaafricamiddle eastcitiesselecteddevelopmentsportfootballcricketrugby unionF1tennisgolfcyclingboxingracingrugby leaguefootballlive scorestablescompetitionsresultsfixturesclubsopinioncolumnistsletterseditorialsculturefilmtv & radiomusicgamesbooksart & designstageclassicalbusinesseconomicsbankingretailmarketseurozonelifestylefoodrecipeshealth & fitnesslove & sexfamilywomenhome & gardenfashionenvironmentclimate changewildlifeenergypollutiontechtravelUKeuropeUSmoneypropertysavingspensionsborrowingcareersscienceprofessional networksthe observertoday's paperobituariesg2weekendthe guidesaturday reviewsunday's papercommentthe new reviewobserver magazinemembershipcrosswordsblogeditorquickcrypticprizequipticgeniusspeedyeverymanazedweekendvideopodcastsdigital archiveWorld\u203aCities\u203aCyclingtravelUKeuropeUSback to topbecome a supportermake a contributionsecuredropsolve technical issueadvertise with uswork for uscontact uscomplaints & correctionsterms & conditionsprivacy policycookie policydigital newspaper archiveall topicsall contributorsFacebookTwitter\u00a9 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
