If the fact-checkers review the post and write a story debunking it or giving context, that post may appear below the original content on Facebook\u2019s news feed, according to a company blog post.Facebook has been taking steps to make sure that new reports spreading on its social network are accurate -- without intervening in a biased way. The company has been working closely with fact-checkers like Snopes and Politifact, experimenting earlier this year with tagging stories as \u201cdisputed by snopes.com,\u201d for example. The effort hasn\u2019t always worked, with the Guardian newspaper reporting that sometimes an authority figure telling people not to read certain stories has caused them to spread faster.After U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s election, Facebook was criticized for allowing misleading information to go viral, potentially resulting in misinformed voters. One viral hoax, for example, claimed that the Pope had endorsed Trump. After initially disputing that fake news on Facebook could have played a role in the election, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg decided the company should prioritize having informed users. In the months since the election, Trump has used the \u201cfake news\u201d term to refer to the mainstream media.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers\u00a9 2017 Time Inc.
