Her op-ed piece for The Telegraph begins as so many pleas to undermine encryption do: with the horrors perpetrated by terrorists. Only now, the parade of horrors tends to sound something like a \"CSI: Cyber\" exposition outtake.Nearly every plot we uncover has a digital element to it. Go online and you will find your own \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d jihad at the click of a mouse. The tentacles of Daesh (Isil) recruiters in Syria reach back to the laptops in the bedrooms of boys \u2013 and increasingly girls \u2013 in our towns and cities up and down the country. The purveyors of far-Right extremism pump out their brand of hate across the globe, without ever leaving home.The scale of what is happening cannot be downplayed. Before he mowed down the innocents on Westminster Bridge and stabbed Pc Keith Palmer, Khalid Masood is thought to have watched extremist videos. Daesh claim to have created 11,000 new social media accounts in May alone. Our analysis shows that three-quarters of Daesh propaganda stories are shared within the first three hours of release \u2013 an hour quicker than a year ago.An hour quicker! In internet time, that's practically a millennium. It's tough to tell what Rudd's attempting to make of this technobabble. Is she suggesting future Masoods will act quicker because they'll be able to complete their viewing of extremist videos faster? If that's the case, maybe regulators need to step in and throttle broadband connections. The more the video buffers, the less likely it is someone will watch it\u2026 and the less likely it is someone will carry out an attack. The math(s) work out.Unfortunately, this is not where the op-ed is heading. Sadly, Rudd is here to take a swing at encryption. But she takes a swing at it in prime passive-aggressive, Ike Turner-style, saying she loves it even as the blows rain home.Encryption plays a fundamental role in protecting us all online. It is key to growing the digital economy, and delivering public services online.I ain't mad at ya.But, like many powerful technologies, encrypted services are used and abused by a small minority of people. The particular challenge is around so called \u201cend-to-end\u201d encryption, where even the service provider cannot see the content of a communication.But you mess me up so much inside.To be very clear \u2013 Government supports strong encryption and has no intention of banning end-to-end encryption. But the inability to gain access to encrypted data in specific and targeted instances \u2013 even with a warrant signed by a Secretary of State and a senior judge \u2013 is right now severely limiting our agencies\u2019 ability to stop terrorist attacks and bring criminals to justice.In a fun twist, Rudd doesn't call for harder nerding. (Note: Rudd is visiting Silicon Valley to meet with tech leaders, so it's safe to assume requests for harder nerding will be made, even if not directly in this op-ed.)No, Rudd doesn't want the impossible: secure, backdoored encryption. Instead, she wants to know if tech companies will just take the encryption off one end of the end-to-end. Her bolstering argument? The public doesn't give a shit about encryption. It just wants easy-to-use communication tools.Real people often prefer ease of use and a multitude of features to perfect, unbreakable security. So this is not about asking the companies to break encryption or create so called \u201cback doors\u201d. Who uses WhatsApp because it is end-to-end encrypted, rather than because it is an incredibly user-friendly and cheap way of staying in touch with friends and family? Companies are constantly making trade-offs between security and \u201cusability\u201d, and it is here where our experts believe opportunities may lie.Having set up her straw app user, Rudd moves towards her conclusion\u2026 which is severely lacking in anything cohesive or coherent. The \"opportunities\" lie in persuading tech companies to provide users with less secure communications platforms. Should be an easy sale, especially if the average user doesn't care about security. But maybe the company does and doesn't want to give bad people an easy way to access the communications of others. Hence encryption. Hence end-to-end, so even if the provider is breached, there's still nothing to access.What Rudd is looking for can't be called a trade-off. The government has nothing tech companies want. All they can offer is platitudes about fighting crime and national security. The government, meanwhile, wants tech companies to write software the way the government wants it, rather than how the company or its users want it. That's not a trade-off. That's a one-way street where every internet communication platform becomes a proxy government agency.Rudd's idea is bad and she should feel bad. But I get the feeling that no matter how many tech experts she talks to, she's still going to believe her way is the right and best way.54 Comments | Leave a CommentIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...UK WiFi Company Uses Overlong TOS To Trick Hotspot Users Into Cleaning Toilets, Hugging Stray CatsRussia Has Banned VPNsSex History Educational Site Wants To Know If It's Going To Be Bricked Up Behind UK's Porn WallIndian ISPs Continue Futile Effort To Prevent Subscribers From Using Decent EncryptionTrump's Pick For FBI Head Sounds A Lot Like The Guy He Fired When It Comes To Encryption Reader CommentsSubscribe: RSSView by: Time | ThreadNinja (profile), 2 Aug 2017 @ 5:54amAccording to these people planes should be raining from the skies and bombs going off like fireworks in crowded western locales.

Encryption helps to ensure you are talking to the person that you believe you are talking to. It's not a guarantee, but it's the closest thing we've got. Without encryption, you might think you're talking to your mum, but you're really talking with an NSA agent. Or ISIL.2. Encryption helps to ensure that the things being said between you and your mum remain between you and your mum. Otherwise, the Daily Mail can easily see everything you type each other and put it on the front page every day, if they so desire.Now you know![\u00a0reply to this\u00a0|\u00a0link to this\u00a0|\u00a0view in chronology\u00a0]JoeCool (profile), 2 Aug 2017 @ 8:09amRe: Lord she's stupidAnd knowing is half the battle![\u00a0reply to this\u00a0|\u00a0link to this\u00a0|\u00a0view in chronology\u00a0]Sarah Black (profile), 2 Aug 2017 @ 9:27amRe: Re: Lord she's stupidDeath by encryption is the other half.[\u00a0reply to this\u00a0|\u00a0link to this\u00a0|\u00a0view in chronology\u00a0]JoeCool (profile), 2 Aug 2017 @ 10:01amRe: Re: Re: Lord she's stupidNo, the meme is 'the other half is violence'.[\u00a0reply to this\u00a0|\u00a0link to this\u00a0|\u00a0view in chronology\u00a0]Sarah Black (profile), 3 Aug 2017 @ 12:18pmRe: Re: Re: Re: Lord she's stupidNot according to Secretary Amber Rudd.And thats the joke.[\u00a0reply to this\u00a0|\u00a0link to this\u00a0|\u00a0view in chronology\u00a0]ECA (profile), 2 Aug 2017 @ 11:14pmRe: Lord she's stupidwho WAS THE WHITE GUY,That WHOLE in the military found a UN-ENCODED CHANNEL with LOTS of world leaders and henchmen, all Chatting??reported it, COPIED IT, and sent it for everyone to listen to??DID they shoot him yet??What can I say..

So, they're not \"real people\", problem solved!\"Real people often prefer ease of use and a multitude of features to perfect, unbreakable security.\"I think most \"real people\" would prefer there to be *both*. If they're told WhatsApp will have to lose features to get proper security, sure they'll go for the features. But, nobody's going to argue *against* increased security if it doesn't affect operation of the app. I haven't seen a single person complain about lack of features since WhatsApp introduced additional security measures.Also, it's true that security has never been as good a selling point as new features in the past. But, guess what changed that and made it a more saleable commodity? That's right, revelations of government spying! The things she's suggesting be allowed are what made people want encryption enforced in messaging apps in the first place...[\u00a0reply to this\u00a0|\u00a0link to this\u00a0|\u00a0view in chronology\u00a0]Anonymous Coward, 2 Aug 2017 @ 7:04ama \"CSI: Cyber\" exposition Do not give them any ideas, although on second thought it might be quite humorous - like that show where they had to upload new firmware to an airplane system before it could land .. or something like that .. anyway, they had to connect via a usb cable - in flight from a vehicle on the runway. lmao.[\u00a0reply to this\u00a0|\u00a0link to this\u00a0|\u00a0view in chronology\u00a0]Anonymous Coward, 2 Aug 2017 @ 7:08amYou know what else we do not want? - uneducated, inexperienced representativesBut somehow this is not important to them.[\u00a0reply to this\u00a0|\u00a0link to this\u00a0|\u00a0view in chronology\u00a0]Anonymous Coward, 2 Aug 2017 @ 8:14amRe:Well, you have been fooled.They are by no means uneducated and by no means inexperienced.They know exactly what they are doing and are very well informed.

To be honest, the Queen does have quite a bit of statutory power in the UK. However, if any monarch ever improperly used any of that power, I think it would be quickly removed.The last time she used her prerogative to prevent something from being discussed in Parliment for example, was to keep Parliment from bypassing her and joining the US in Iraq.

Stone (profile), 2 Aug 2017 @ 11:36pmRe: Re: Re: Re: Re:Mere mention of 2nd Amendment is call for violence, eh?The Second Amendment guarantees US citizens the right to bear arms (i.e., own a gun). Any mention of that amendment carries an immediate association with guns. Therefore, any mention of the Second Amendment that does not have to do with passing gun control laws must be associated with gun violence.Last year, Donald Trump said \u201cSecond Amendment people\u201d could stop Hillary Clinton\u2019s agenda if she were elected president. Nobody with any ounce of sense believed that he was referring to the National Rifle Association; his wording was as close to a publicly broadcasted threat on a politician\u2019s life that I have ever seen or heard from a US political campaign. And this is not even the first time a Republican politician has used this type of phrasing to describe gun violence\u2014Sharron Angle repeatedly brought up the idea of \u201cSecond Amendment remedies\u201d during her 2010 campaign for the US Senate.Given the wording of the subject line in the original comment, that poster obviously believes in and endorses the idea of people inflicting violence upon government officials under the guise of \u201cprotecting the rights of citizens\u201d or some other, similar reasoning. The reference to the Second Amendment\u2014which anti-gun control activists generally believe acts as a \u201ccheck\u201d against a tyrannical government\u2014makes that belief clear.But carrying such a \u201cremedy\u201d would not accomplish the goal of \u201cprotecting\u201d anyone. The killing of a politician would only serve to drive them further into secrecy and behind closed doors\u2014out of concerns for safety, at first, but then because it is easier to \u201cget things done\u201d without worrying about all those bothersome citizens getting in the way. And that does not even get into how politicians might feel the need to further militarize the police in the wake of \u201ca threat to democracy\u201d or try to infringe upon the right of peaceful protesting as \u201ca precautionary safety measure\u201d.I believe in the Constitutional right of a US citizen to legally own a firearm. I do not, however, believe that right entitles a US citizen to inflict any kind of violence upon any government official and justify said violence with the excuse of \u201cI was protecting my rights from a government threat\u201d.

It's not that the government is trying to weaken locks. It's simply that people don't want locks.Thank you for your cooperation, which will make it unnecessary to legislate the removal or weakening of locks.[\u00a0reply to this\u00a0|\u00a0link to this\u00a0|\u00a0view in chronology\u00a0]Anonymous Coward, 2 Aug 2017 @ 9:03amMath Don't Play \"Real people often prefer ease of use and a multitude of features to perfect, unbreakable security.\" [emphasis added]Complex people almost always prefer that security be as close as possible to the imaginary ideals of perfect and unbreakable.Math you, Amber![\u00a0reply to this\u00a0|\u00a0link to this\u00a0|\u00a0view in chronology\u00a0]orbitalinsertion (profile), 2 Aug 2017 @ 11:19amI still want to know how often anyone has stopped anything because they were intercepting non-encrypted communications. The certainly miss things with known actors and already intercepted communications. Then they can tell us what they really missed for realsies in encrypted information which they decrypted later, which even maybe kinda sorta might have helped had it not been encrypted when someone bothered to analyze it.Still waiting on this...[\u00a0reply to this\u00a0|\u00a0link to this\u00a0|\u00a0view in chronology\u00a0]ECA (profile), 2 Aug 2017 @ 11:36amEnd to END??Excuse me as Iv been around computers to long..END TO END tends to have a big problem if you wish to be PUBLIC..

No-one knowledgeable in the field is likely to claim that 'perfect, unbreakable security' is possible, rather the goal is to get as close to that as possible and always strive to make it better, not worse.So this is not about asking the companies to break encryption or create so called \u201cback doors\u201d.Flat out lie. When you've got people arguing that companies need to be able to decrypt communications that is absolutely \"'asking the companies to break encryption or create so called 'back doors'\". Encryption that can be bypassed at a whim by those other that the sender and recipient is broken encryption, lying about it doesn't change this fact.Who uses WhatsApp because it is end-to-end encrypted, rather than because it is an incredibly user-friendly and cheap way of staying in touch with friends and family?False Dichotomy.As several others have pointed out these are not mutually exclusive, I imagine plenty of people use it for it's user-friendly interface and because it's secure. Even if that were not the case whether or not a company should offer working encryption is up to the company and customers, not the government and it's agencies.Companies are constantly making trade-offs between security and \u201cusability\u201d, and it is here where our experts believe opportunities may lie.In which case your 'experts' need to be fired immediately, as they're not only idiots they're dangerous idiots. As you yourself noted people seem to enjoy Whatsapp just fine, with it's ease-of-use and robust security, so the 'trade-off' you're proposing is for them to make their product worse simply in order to make your lives slightly easier.[\u00a0reply to this\u00a0|\u00a0link to this\u00a0|\u00a0view in chronology\u00a0]stosh, 2 Aug 2017 @ 4:10pmI agree to give up encryption, if they are willing to do their online banking on unsecured wi-fi networks.
